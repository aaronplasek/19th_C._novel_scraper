            <head n="comhd1">PROSPECTUS<lb/>  
OF THE<lb/>  
LIBRARY OF SELECT NOVELS.</head>
            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Fictitious</hi> composition is now admitted to form an extensive and <lb/>important portion of literature. Well-wrought novels take their rank by the<lb/>  
side of real narratives, and are appealed to as evidence in all questions<lb/>  
concerning man. In them the customs of countries, the transitions and<lb/>  
shades of character, and even the very peculiarities of costume and <lb/>dialect, are curiously preserved; and the imperishable spirit that surrounds<lb/>  
and keeps them for the use of successive generations renders the rarities<lb/>  
for ever fresh and green. In them human life is laid down as on a map.<lb/>  
The strong and vivid exhibitions of passion and of character which they<lb/>  
furnish, acquire and maintain the strongest hold upon the curiosity, and,<lb/>  
it may be added, the affections of every class of readers; for not only is<lb/>  
entertainment in all the various moods of tragedy and comedy provided in<lb/>  
their pages, but he who reads them attentively may often obtain, without<lb/>  
the bitterness and danger of experience, that knowledge of his <lb/>fellow-creatures which but for such aid could, in the majority of cases, be only<lb/>  
acquired at a period of life too late to turn it to account.</p>
            <p>This “Library of Select Novels” will embrace none but such as have<lb/>  
received the impress of general approbation, or have been written by<lb/>  
authors of established character; and the publishers hope to receive such<lb/>  
encouragement from the public patronage as will enable them in the<lb/>  
course of time to produce a series of works of uniform appearance, and<lb/>  
including most of the really valuable novels and romances that have been<lb/>  
or shall be issued from the modern English and American press.</p>
            <p>There is scarcely any question connected with the interests of literature<lb/>  
which has been more thoroughly discussed and investigated than that of<lb/>  
the utility or evil of novel reading. In its favour much may be and has<lb/>  
been said, and it must be admitted that the reasonings of those who <lb/>believe novels to be injurious, or at least useless, are not without force and<lb/>  
plausibility. Yet, if the arguments against novels are closely examined,<lb/>  
it will be found that they are more applicable in general to excessive <lb/>indulgence in the pleasures afforded by the perusal of fictitious adventures<lb/>  
than to the works themselves; and that the evils which can be justly<lb/>  
ascribed to them arise almost exclusively, not from any peculiar noxious<lb/>  
qualities that can be fairly attributed to novels as a species, but from those<lb/>  
individual works which in their class must be pronounced to be <lb/>indifferent.</p>
            <p>But even were it otherwise—were novels of every kind, the good as<lb/>  
well as the bad, the striking and animated not less than the puerile, <lb/>indeed liable to the charge of enfeebling or perverting the mind; and were<lb/>  
there no qualities in any which might render them instructive as well as<lb/>  
amusing—the universal acceptation which they have ever received, and<lb/>  
still continue to receive, from all ages and classes of men, would prove<lb/>  
an irresistible incentive to their production. The remonstrances of <lb/>moralists and the reasonings of philosophy have ever been, and will still be<lb/>  
found, unavailing against the desire to partake of an enjoyment so <lb/>attractive. Men will read novels; and therefore the utmost that wisdom and<lb/>  
philanthropy can do is to cater prudently for the public appetite, and, as it<lb/>  
is hopeless to attempt the exclusion of fictitious writings from the shelves<lb/>  
of the library, to see that they are encumbered with the least possible<lb/>  
number of such as have no other merit than that of novelty.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> letter from Mr. S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clapp</hi> which follows this <lb/>announcement will sufficiently explain to the reader the<lb/>  
manner in which the manuscripts from which the tales in<lb/>  
these volumes have been printed came into the possession<lb/>  
of the Publishers. Having obtained permission from Mr.<lb/>  
E. Clapp to take time for consideration, they were inclined<lb/>  
to believe on inspection that the handwriting of a <lb/>portion of the collection was not new to them. But on<lb/>  
applying to the quarter suspected, they obtained no <lb/>admissions or information which threw any light upon the<lb/>  
subject. They then submitted the whole to a select<lb/>  
committee of five gentlemen, distinguished in private<lb/>  
for their critical acumen. Their report was a singular<lb/>  
one; inasmuch as each one unequivocally condemned,<lb/>  
as un-typeworthy, four-fifths of the whole; but the<lb/>  
single and separate fifths which separately pleased each<lb/>  
of them, and on which each bestowed high <lb/>commendations (no two of them agreeing), made up the entire<lb/>  
fardel which Mr. Clapp wished to dispose of.</p>
            <p>Under these circumstances they bethought themselves<lb/>  
of procuring an inspection of the books kept at the<lb/>  
Spa; and through the kind offices of a friend were <lb/>enabled to ascertain that among those whose names were<lb/>  
entered as having visited the new spring were Miss <lb/>Sedgwick, Messrs. Paulding, Bryant, Sands, and Leggett.<lb/>  
The name of G. C. Verplanck had been written, but a<lb/>  
line was drawn through it, as if the entry had been made<lb/>  
by mistake. There were no other names to whom <lb/>
               <pb n="006"/>suspicion could attach; and the Publishers have been <lb/>unable, in reply to very polite inquiries, to obtain any light<lb/>  
from the parties mentioned. They disclaimed, however,<lb/>  
any right of property in the manuscripts, the contents<lb/>  
of which are now given to the public; sanctioned, in<lb/>  
the manner which has been mentioned, by the opinions<lb/>  
of five gentlemen of discriminating taste. That they<lb/>  
may afford pleasure to the reader, and some profit to<lb/>  
Mr. Clapp, who is ascertained to be a man of <lb/>exemplary character, and who has suffered so unexpectedly<lb/>  
from the late painful affliction with which the land has<lb/>  
been visited, is the sincere desire and hope of</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> letter my son, Eli Clapp, will hand you, along<lb/>  
with the parcel. I do not suppose you know me,<lb/>  
though I have advertised once in one of your York <lb/>papers; and the only way I came to know you was by <lb/>seeing in it that you printed all the books, and I take the<lb/>  
freedom of writing to you on the strength of it.</p>
            <p>I have lived at Sheep's Neck since I was a boy, and<lb/>  
so did my father before me; but we have altered the<lb/>  
name lately to Glauber-spaw, and call the Old <lb/>Ram's-alley Epsom-walk, out of a notion of the doctor's and<lb/>  
my daughters. I will tell you how it happened, or else<lb/>  
you would not understand how I came to write to you.</p>
            <p>I lived on the old homestead, man and boy, and was<lb/>  
married and had a family of children, for forty years and<lb/>  
rising, when my wife would send my daughters to a<lb/>  
fashionable school in Wetherville, to learn French and<lb/>  
darning-work and the forte-piano. I cannot say I had<lb/>  
much peace after that. From one thing to another, I<lb/>  
was obliged to build two new wings and a back-kitchen<lb/>  
to the old house; and when those were finished, that<lb/>  
was pulled down and another built, as they said it was<lb/>  
not in good taste. It tasted better to me altogether<lb/>  
than the new place; for I was obliged to raise money<lb/>
               <pb n="008"/>  
on a mortgage to pay for the <hi rend="italics">willer,</hi> as they called it,<lb/>  
after they had cut down all the willers that were to be<lb/>  
found upon it. They found the furniture, too, but I had<lb/>  
to pay for it; and when it was in order, as they said, it<lb/>  
was such a trumpery, bandbox-looking place, that I<lb/>  
could not spit in it with any comfort.</p>
            <p>The next thing they did, and by this time they had<lb/>  
got my wife and youngest son all on their side (though<lb/>  
Eli, who is a discreet lad, went and lived in the barn,<lb/>  
and would not come inside of their shingle-shanty, as<lb/>  
he called it), was to say that Sheep's Neck was no name<lb/>  
at all for the farm. I told them they might call it Clapp's<lb/>  
Folly, if they liked; at which they turned up their<lb/>  
noses, and talked about St. Romans, and <lb/>Tully-veal-and-lamb, and Mount-Peeler, and Bawl-town, and other<lb/>  
names, to which I did not see no likeness in the <lb/>premises.</p>
            <p>Just about this time young Doctor Jodine, who had<lb/>  
come to settle in the village, and soon got thick with my<lb/>  
wife and daughters, began to analyze, as he called it, the<lb/>  
waters of my spring, which we had all been drinking<lb/>  
for ever, taking it to be plain water. But it was no<lb/>  
such thing. The doctor made a memorandum of what<lb/>  
it was, which he had published in a pamphlet, now for<lb/>  
sale at the bookstore in Sheep's Neck Village. It had<lb/>  
saline and gaseous properties, and was made out of <lb/>different kinds of stuff, in which there was plenty of <lb/>oxhides and gin, as far as I can understand it, with a good<lb/>  
deal of sulphur and soda. It is strange how the water<lb/>  
did not seem to affect us any before the doctor had <lb/>analyzed it. But after he had had the spring walled in,<lb/>  
and let it off through logs so as to make it squirt up in<lb/>  
a fountain, it is really astonishing how we came to find<lb/>  
out its properties, and the kimistry of it. I take this<lb/>  
opportunity of begging you to contradict a false tale<lb/>  
which some of the neighbours who go to the second<lb/>  
meeting-house got up, and which I have denied in my<lb/>
               <pb n="009"/>  
advertisement, that the doctor buried a barrel of salts<lb/>  
and potashes under the spring, which I know not to be<lb/>  
the fact.</p>
            <p>The kimistry of this water, after it was found out,<lb/>  
troubled me considerable. I suffered in body and <lb/>estate; as the doctor's bill was highish, and I lost a fine<lb/>  
heifer and two of my best hogs, who drank out of the<lb/>  
fountain by mistake. There was little left of the poor<lb/>  
things but the hide and bristles. The doctor said that<lb/>  
the Spaw, as he called it, was medicine-like, and must<lb/>  
only be taken by advice, as it was good for <lb/>vallydinarians. We had a fine well on the farm, in which there<lb/>  
is no flavour of hides or potashes that ever I tasted. I<lb/>  
took to drinking that out of the bucket, to avoid <lb/>mistakes; but my wife and daughters took half a tumbler<lb/>  
of the Spaw every morning before breakfast, by the<lb/>  
doctor's advice, as he observed they seemed to be in<lb/>  
delicate health—which they did. They were almost as<lb/>  
lean as the poor heifer and swine; and are not much<lb/>  
better off in flesh now, though they have left off <lb/>drinking the Spaw, and been taking what the doctor calls<lb/>  
tunnicks.</p>
            <p>It was not long after he had fixed up the spring, before<lb/>  
my neighbour Woolley Lamb, who keeps the tavern and<lb/>  
post-office at Sheep's Neck Village, sent his son Chris<lb/>  
one evening to tell our folks that a carriage-load of<lb/>  
people were asking him where the Spaw was, and<lb/>  
whether they could get boarded there. My wife and<lb/>  
daughters overheard the message, and very much to my<lb/>  
surprise came fluttering out, like a clothes-wash in a<lb/>  
gale of wind. I had boarded the Yankee schoolmaster,<lb/>  
off and on, several years before; and some high-flying<lb/>  
girls that had been at school with mine had come to see<lb/>  
them for a spell, after they had reformed the house, as<lb/>  
they called it; during which I spent the most of my<lb/>  
spare hours in the barn, along with Eli. But I had no<lb/>  
idea of taking regular boarders, though for that matter,<lb/>
               <pb n="010"/>  
I did not see what else the new house was good for.<lb/>  
Presently the doctor came up in the wagon, with my<lb/>  
youngest son Cush, who had a load of unaccountable<lb/>  
victuals and sauce, enough to last a whole winter. The<lb/>  
doctor said that a member of Congress's family had<lb/>  
come; and that two of the ladies were vallydinarians,<lb/>  
who had been sent from away south to Glauber-Spaw,<lb/>  
as the only place where they could get rid of their <lb/>pulmonitory symptoms, and be saved from dying a natural<lb/>  
death.</p>
            <p>How my wife and daughters fixed it, I did not know,<lb/>  
and hardly understand to this day. The party presently<lb/>  
came up in a great coach and four, and a gig with two<lb/>  
negroes a-horseback. I thought it was none of my<lb/>  
business to help them in, as I was not allowed to <lb/>hinder them from doing it. The carriages and all the<lb/>  
cattle, as I found on coming back at evening, had been<lb/>  
put into the barn, and poor Eli's chamber was broken<lb/>  
up; and there was a great deal of clatter in the house,<lb/>  
and my wife and daughters were so busy, and looked so<lb/>  
airy, that there was no getting a word out of them. I<lb/>  
was put down by being told by my woman, when I came<lb/>  
to talk to her, that if I would only mind the farm, she<lb/>  
would make a mint of money, that the girls would get<lb/>  
well married, and that I need not trouble myself about<lb/>  
the Spaw House, as Cush would see about it all.</p>
            <p>Not to be too long with my story, I made myself as<lb/>  
busy as I could with working the farm, and got my<lb/>  
meals in the kitchen or in the fields, not troubling <lb/>myself with the traps that they had up stairs, though I saw<lb/>  
much coming and going, and some new faces. Cold<lb/>  
weather came, and the house was empty; and some<lb/>  
people that my wife had hired, unbeknown to me, were<lb/>  
sent off. They looked as fine, almost, as the boarders,<lb/>  
and had shown no more respect to me when they came<lb/>  
straggling about, than if the land did not belong to me.<lb/>  
As they were going out of the gate the sarciest one of<lb/>
               <pb n="011"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
the lot took off his hat in a contemptible kind of a<lb/>  
manner, and said, “Good-by, daddy.” I gave him a<lb/>  
few kicks that sent him rather anyhow into Merino<lb/>  
Creek, that they now called Magnesia Springs; and<lb/>  
Eli, taking his ox-goad to the balance of them, made<lb/>  
them “walk Spanish,” as they say here. They sued<lb/>  
us for it, and the case is not tried yet. I don't see how<lb/>  
they are to get any witnesses.</p>
            <p>Eli told me he was going to be married to a <lb/>neighbour's daughter, and live on his farm; though he would<lb/>  
help me to work mine for fair wages, and carry the<lb/>  
stuff to market for me in partnership. He never asked<lb/>  
his mother and sisters to the wedding, and so they don't<lb/>  
speak. Presently my neighbour Colonel Cross, who<lb/>  
had the mortgage, came for a year's interest, and part<lb/>  
of the principal, which he had a right to ask for. My<lb/>  
crops had been bad, and though I had cut considerable<lb/>  
hay, what with mending fences when the high-flyers at<lb/>  
the Spaw House had broken them, paying the hands,<lb/>  
and getting little or nothing from the market for <lb/>vegetables, as the most of them had been wasted in the<lb/>  
house, I had not ready money enough to pay even the<lb/>  
interest. So I went to my wife, who had all along<lb/>  
been blarneying me, when she got time to talk, about<lb/>  
her great prospects. But she opened her eyes, and<lb/>  
asked me if I was crazy, to think she could catch money<lb/>  
at once, out of the clouds, after all the expense she<lb/>  
had been at? I never heard her talk such hard words<lb/>  
before, as she had picked up from the strangers she had<lb/>  
been waiting on; and I do not wonder at it, for I heard<lb/>  
that some of them were Nullyflyers; and I am told<lb/>  
that those sort of people are not Christians, and are a<lb/>  
kind of unnat'ral like. She talked about divestments,<lb/>  
and futer returns, and the goose that laid the golden<lb/>  
eggs. This was all I understood of her new-fashioned<lb/>  
prose; and I could not help saying rather <lb/>passionate-like, “Burn my old clothes, misses, if you haven't <lb/>
               <pb n="012"/>divested me of my farm, and I won't have no futer <lb/>returns to it, that's flat. You're a goose yourself, and<lb/>  
have made a gander of me, and where are the golden<lb/>  
eggs?” Then she showed me all the bills for furniture,<lb/>  
and groceries, and servants (she paid them vagabonds<lb/>  
more for a month than I can make off the farm), and<lb/>  
told me she had paid nearly half of them. And she<lb/>  
said that next season she could make an estate, as all<lb/>  
the company had promised to come back and bring good<lb/>  
society with them, if she would make more room for<lb/>  
them. And she showed me a parcel of trash that had<lb/>  
been given to the girls,—singing-books, and old clothes,<lb/>  
and poetry-works, and smelling-bottles, which she said<lb/>  
were invaluable proofs of regard from the genteel ladies<lb/>  
that would take care of Sally and Nancy.</p>
            <p>I saw that I was in a hobbleshow, and I knew that<lb/>  
Colonel Cross was twistical; but I did not know how<lb/>  
to help myself, when he came and said that he must<lb/>  
have money, and could not afford to wait for it; but<lb/>  
that if I would give another mortgage for three times<lb/>  
as much as the principal and interest came to on the<lb/>  
whole farm, he would lift the other, as he knew a man<lb/>  
in Wetherville who would advance it if I would make<lb/>  
further improvements, so as to accommodate all the <lb/>company that would like to come. He said my wife and<lb/>  
daughters were smart and active; and that, as I did not<lb/>  
know any thing about it, he would see to the <lb/>improvements himself, if I would give him a commission. I<lb/>  
did not know what he meant, and told him he must go<lb/>  
to the governor for that, but found out that he wanted<lb/>  
to be paid for his trouble.</p>
            <p>I had a heavy heart enough when I signed the new<lb/>  
mortgage, and did not get a cent of the money; which<lb/>  
the colonel put into the bank to pay for the <lb/>improvements; and I spent a melancholy winter, having no<lb/>  
good of my family, and being often driven out of doors<lb/>  
in cold weather by the everlasting strumming that was<lb/>
               <pb n="013"/>  
kept up on the cracked piano, which, I was told for my<lb/>  
comfort, was to be changed for a new one. The spring<lb/>  
had hardly come when the whole place was covered<lb/>  
with timber and carpenters. The colonel was boss,<lb/>  
and I was told I had nothing to do with it, though I had<lb/>  
made up my mind to that before. Another story was<lb/>  
put upon the house, with long painted shanties, and<lb/>  
sheds, and stables, and boxes with crosses and vanes<lb/>  
upon them, all about the premises. They put one of<lb/>  
these up on the hill we used to call Sheep's Misery,<lb/>  
which they called New 'Limpus, over Merino Creek;<lb/>  
and in the next general rain it limped down of its own<lb/>  
accord; and it cost more, I was told, to put it up the<lb/>  
second time than it had done the first.</p>
            <p>They had not got every thing painted and varnished<lb/>  
and gilded, and cleared away the chips, and got in the<lb/>  
wagon-loads of curosities that they bought for furniture,<lb/>  
before we heard that the cholera morbus had come over<lb/>  
along with twenty thousand paddies and radikles into<lb/>  
Canada, up to the north; and the people talked about<lb/>  
nothing but whether it would come into these parts.<lb/>  
The doctor had newspapers and tracts which he brought<lb/>  
every day, and said he could cure it with the Spaw.<lb/>  
Sometimes he said it was the real sphixy that had killed<lb/>  
so many abroad, and then he said it wasn't. And he<lb/>  
talked about premonitories, and made us show our<lb/>  
tongues. He wanted me to take some pills; but I<lb/>  
told him it was out of the contract, and I did not belong<lb/>  
to the Spaw. But my wife and daughters took them,<lb/>  
and a sorrowful time they had of it. I believe he<lb/>  
would have gone on physicking them, and killed them,<lb/>  
as he did an old maid in the village, if it had not been<lb/>  
that he would have had no patients at the house if there<lb/>  
had been no one to keep it.</p>
            <p>We soon heard that the cholera had got into York<lb/>  
State. We had then but a few boarders, who all drank<lb/>  
regularly of the water, and yet had premonitories all<lb/>
               <pb n="014"/>  
the time. But when the news came that it was in the<lb/>  
city, there was in a few weeks such a run of people<lb/>  
that the house would hold no more, and they boarded<lb/>  
about with all the neighbours. Among them was a<lb/>  
town doctor, who said his nerves could not stand the<lb/>  
sight of the disease; and he too talked about nothing<lb/>  
but premonitories. Our doctor and he at first had a<lb/>  
quarrel, and my wife talked of turning him out of doors,<lb/>  
when he said it would be certain death to drink the<lb/>  
Spaw. But the two doctors soon made it up, as they<lb/>  
seemed to be likely to have business enough for both.<lb/>  
Then our doctor gave notice that he would give a <lb/>public lecture gratis about the disease, in the meeting-house,<lb/>  
and we all went to it. I did not pretend to understand<lb/>  
it, nor did I find any one who did; only it was fixed now<lb/>  
that it was the real sphixy, and that a collapse couldn't<lb/>  
be cured. I believed as much, for I was aboard of a<lb/>  
steamboat when one of the flues bursted. They called<lb/>  
it a collapse; and I am certain it was easier to make a<lb/>  
new one than to mend that. When he came to talk<lb/>  
about premonitories and the spasms, there began<lb/>  
soon to be a sighing and grunting, and finally a <lb/>general groaning, for all the world like anxious meeting.<lb/>  
Everybody, women and all, were putting their hands<lb/>  
over their bowels; and my neighbour Slaughter, the<lb/>  
butcher, who weighs twenty-three stone, clapped his on<lb/>  
each of his sides, and getting up to give them a squeeze,<lb/>  
set up a sort of a bellow like one of his own bullocks<lb/>  
going to be killed. I felt a little squirmish myself,<lb/>  
though I had not noticed it before. When he came to<lb/>  
tell what was good to eat and drink, it was curious to<lb/>  
hear him. I did not see that he left any thing for our<lb/>  
victuals but beef and rice. Neighbour Slaughter<lb/>  
stroked down his jacket as if he felt a little more <lb/>comfortable, when he talked of beef; but I felt more <lb/>uneasy than before, thinking what was to become of all<lb/>  
my peas, and beans, and beets, and onions, and all kinds<lb/>
               <pb n="015"/>  
of sauce, and corn, and watermilions, which he said it<lb/>  
would be wilful murder to eat. All liquids he said<lb/>  
must be avoided; and as for the Spaw, he explained<lb/>  
how the air was so peculiar-like, that what was good<lb/>  
physic in common times was poison now, and a kind<lb/>  
of worked backwards. But he said that as long as the<lb/>  
people staid quiet there, the air was better than it was<lb/>  
anywhere else; and if they minded the premonitories,<lb/>  
and sent for him or his friend Doctor Nervy when<lb/>  
they got them, there was no manner of danger. He<lb/>  
also gave notice that he would make out a list of what<lb/>  
was proper to be eaten at the Spaw House for the <lb/>benefit of strangers.</p>
            <p>For the matter of that, though I only saw what was<lb/>  
going on in the kitchen sometimes, they seemed to have<lb/>  
pretty much the same cooking that they had the year<lb/>  
before, when the Congress-people and Nullyflyers had<lb/>  
been there; except that all the beautiful vegetables,<lb/>  
which never looked nicer before, were left alone. I<lb/>  
was not sorry for this, except that I could not have them<lb/>  
cooked for myself without going over to Eli's, where I<lb/>  
soon made a bargain to get my dinner regular and <lb/>comfortable. But after he had been to market a few times,<lb/>  
and come back complaining that he could not sell his<lb/>  
load to the huckster-women, he returned at last with the<lb/>  
whole load; saying he had been ordered off by the<lb/>  
mare's men in the market; that all the shops were shut,<lb/>  
and the streets whitewashed; and that everybody that<lb/>  
died had eaten some premonitory or another. And<lb/>  
being a hasty man, who has not yet got religion, he<lb/>  
damned the cholera morbus, and the mare, and the <lb/>vegetables too, in a profane manner—though that you need<lb/>  
not mention.</p>
            <p>Half the people were kept half-sick, and the rest did<lb/>  
not look well, and the two doctors had business all the<lb/>  
time; and I began to think my wife might make <lb/>something of a spec out of the business, as the boarders<lb/>
               <pb n="016"/>  
seemed glad enough to sleep anywhere, and fare as they<lb/>  
could. Two or three times when I looked in by <lb/>accident, at night, I saw a party in one room that were <lb/>reading written papers aloud; and from what I heard my<lb/>  
wife and daughters talking about it, I gathered that they<lb/>  
amused themselves with it, and that it was made out<lb/>  
of their own heads. I thought it as good a way of<lb/>  
killing time as any, and better than strumming on the<lb/>  
forte-piano, which was kept a-going from morning till<lb/>  
night, till a child fell through the cover one day, and<lb/>  
smashed all the wire-works. I was plaguy glad of<lb/>  
this, for I didn't mind the fidells, and flutes, and <lb/>tambyreens that they got to dance to, half so bad as the nasty<lb/>  
noise, to no tune at all, that they made with the piano.<lb/>  
Luckily there was nobody to mend it, and the poor<lb/>  
thing stays smashed to this minute. I don't believe it<lb/>  
will fetch much.</p>
            <p>But to come to the marrow of the matter, after these<lb/>  
premonitories, one night, about two weeks ago, my old<lb/>  
negro Samboney, who lives with his wife Dinah in a little<lb/>  
old stone house near the Spaw, complained of a great<lb/>  
many of them. I didn't see any good the doctors did,<lb/>  
and Samboney was awful afraid of them. He said he<lb/>  
had drunk nothing all day but hard cider, and eat no<lb/>  
thing but salt pork and plenty of the nice vegetables<lb/>  
Master Eli gave him (being some of the same that<lb/>  
would have been wasted otherwise), and some <lb/>watermilions, hard biled eggs, and nice green apples. Dinah<lb/>  
said he had taken near a pint of spirits too, which was<lb/>  
but natural in the poor neger; for after such a mess I<lb/>  
should have taken some myself, for all Doctor Skinner<lb/>  
and Doctor Nervy might have said. I told him to be<lb/>  
quiet, and Dinah to kiver him up; but I had hardly<lb/>  
sneaked into bed in the little room on the <lb/>groundfloor, where my wife had put me since the company<lb/>  
came, and begun to get asleep, when I heard Dinah<lb/>  
screaming and thumping at the door, and bawling out,<lb/>
               <pb n="017"/>  
“Cholera Morbish!—Samboney has got him!—He's a<lb/>  
kicking down the house!—Cholera!—Cholera!” loud<lb/>  
enough to wake the dead, and scare all the <lb/>vallydinarians out of all the life that was left in them. I got up,<lb/>  
while she kept on hollering; and when I went out, it<lb/>  
was a curious thing to see and hear. There was all<lb/>  
the people in the windows and piazzas to the back of<lb/>  
the house, in their night-clothes, some screeching as if<lb/>  
they had fits; and there was the nigger-wench in her<lb/>  
white shimmey, dancing a rigadoon on the grass, and<lb/>  
pulling out her wool, and thumping herself like a <lb/>possessed body in the New Testament. And when she<lb/>  
yelled out “Cholera!—Cholera!” it put me in mind of<lb/>  
the cry of wo set up in the streets of the old Jerusalem<lb/>  
by a crazy man, which I used to read about in Josephus,<lb/>  
when I had a clean place to set down in and read any<lb/>  
thing.</p>
            <p>There was a general mixture of noises and running<lb/>  
about the house; but I could hear calls for Doctor<lb/>  
Nervy, and cries of “Send for Doctor Skinner,” more<lb/>  
than any thing else. Doctor Nervy at last came out<lb/>  
on the upper piazza in his flannel night-gown, with a<lb/>  
blanket over it, though the nights were as hot as Tophet<lb/>  
(as I had heard Eli profanely remark), with a bottle at<lb/>  
his nose, and a candle in his hand, to help him see the<lb/>  
moonshine. When he heard and saw Dinah, he looked<lb/>  
flustrated, and said she was crazy, and must be tied and<lb/>  
taken away, till he could attend to her in the morning.<lb/>  
The wench was in a great passion to hear him say this,<lb/>  
and went on screaming, “You no tie me!—Come tie<lb/>  
Samboney!—Cholera got him!—He kick down de<lb/>  
house and bedstead!—Cholera!—Cholera!—C'lapses,<lb/>  
spazemzes, and plemoneraries—he got um all!”</p>
            <p>The doctor said if Dinah wasn't tied he could not<lb/>  
answer for the health of his nervous patients; whom<lb/>  
he besought to get into bed, as he meant to do himself.<lb/>  
Some of the servants ran to the village for Doctor<lb/>
               <pb n="018"/>  
Skinner, and some went with me, at a respectful <lb/>distance however, as I pushed Dinah ahead, and followed<lb/>  
her to the house. Sure enough, poor Samboney had<lb/>  
kicked out the foot-board of the bed, and thrown off all<lb/>  
the clothes. He was an awful spectacle, and roared<lb/>  
terribly. We could not keep clothes on him, or make<lb/>  
him be quiet, until he became so of his own accord,<lb/>  
after an hour or more. Then his nails were as blue as<lb/>  
indigo. We could hardly say whether he breathed or<lb/>  
not, and he lay with his eyes open, quite resigned-like,<lb/>  
as if he had given up fighting the cholera, and meant to<lb/>  
leave the end to Providence. He was just so when<lb/>  
the doctor came. He did not know, I believe, whether<lb/>  
Sam was alive or dead. He talked a good deal of<lb/>  
what he could do if he could get apparatus, and said he<lb/>  
must have a consultation with Doctor Nervy. But he<lb/>  
wouldn't come, and had locked his door, ordering from<lb/>  
the window that no one should be let into the room who<lb/>  
had been near the case. Doctor Skinner then stuck a<lb/>  
lancet into Samboney, but no blood came that would<lb/>  
trickle; and he got the whiskey-bottle, and would have<lb/>  
crammed the muzzle into the poor fellow's mouth, but<lb/>  
his teeth were set so tight that he only spilled it all over<lb/>  
him. The short and long of it was, that Sam died an<lb/>  
hour before daylight; and the peculiarest part of all was,<lb/>  
that he began to kick again after he was a dead corpse.</p>
            <p>When daylight did come, every carriage was ordered<lb/>  
up to the door, and such as had none were off on foot<lb/>  
to the village, some of them without remembering even<lb/>  
to ask for their bills. My wife and daughters stood on<lb/>  
the steps with real tears in their eyes; and I cannot<lb/>  
but say, that the two latter were served shabbily enough.<lb/>  
Mrs. Mullock had been pressing them hard to take a<lb/>  
short jaunt with her to the Falls; and now they wanted<lb/>  
to go there out of pure fright. But though there was<lb/>  
plenty of room in the carriage, she crammed it full of<lb/>  
bandboxes and unwashed clothes, to show the <lb/>
               <pb n="019"/>impossibility of the thing, and said she depended on seeing<lb/>  
them in Alabama next season.</p>
            <p>Before breakfast-time not a stranger was left in the<lb/>  
house. Doctor Nervy was one of the first who run<lb/>  
off. And though there has been but one case in the<lb/>  
neighbourhood since, and that five miles distant, not a<lb/>  
soul has come to the Spaw.</p>
            <p>What is to become of my farm and the fine house I<lb/>  
do not know. I suppose neighbour Cross must have<lb/>  
both.</p>
            <p>On looking about the rooms, and at the various <lb/>rubbish which had been left, I found, in one where the<lb/>  
reading-party used to meet by themselves, a great pile<lb/>  
of papers, making, I should say, many quires of <lb/>foolscap. I thought, though they had been left as good for<lb/>  
nothing, and were of no use to me, they might turn to<lb/>  
some account. But I resolved to have the speculation<lb/>  
all to myself; and on talking to Eli, he thought there<lb/>  
would be no harm in seeing what the papers were<lb/>  
worth. They have not been inquired after in two<lb/>  
weeks, and I do not know whose they are; so I <lb/>conclude they belong to me. If you will give any thing<lb/>  
for them, I will trust to you to fix the price. I am an<lb/>  
unfortunate man; and every trifle will help me that I<lb/>  
can come by in an honest way. There were other<lb/>  
scraps and blotted papers about the house, and some<lb/>  
love-letters and verses; but I take it for granted they<lb/>  
are not worth any thing.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> hold our existence at the mercy of the elements;<lb/>  
the life of man is a state of continual vigilance against<lb/>  
their warfare. The heats of noon would wither him<lb/>  
like the severed herb; the chills and dews of night<lb/>  
would fill his bones with pain; the winter frost would<lb/>  
extinguish life in an hour; the hail would smite him to<lb/>  
death, did he not seek shelter and protection against<lb/>  
them. His clothing is the perpetual armour he wears<lb/>  
for his defence, and his dwelling the fortress to which<lb/>  
he retreats for safety. Yet, even there the elements<lb/>  
attack him; the winds overthrow his habitation; the<lb/>  
waters sweep it away. The fire, that warmed and<lb/>  
brightened it within, seizes upon its walls and consumes<lb/>  
it, with his wretched family. The earth, where she<lb/>  
seems to spread a paradise for his abode, sends up<lb/>  
death in exhalations from her bosom; and the heavens<lb/>  
dart down lightnings to destroy him. The drought<lb/>  
consumes the harvests on which he relied for sustenance;<lb/>
               <pb n="194"/>  
or the rains cause the green corn to “rot ere its youth<lb/>  
attains a beard.” A sudden blast ingulfs him in the<lb/>  
waters of the lake or bay from which he seeks his<lb/>  
food; a false step, or a broken twig, precipitates him<lb/>  
from the tree which he had climbed for its fruit; oaks<lb/>  
falling in the storm, rocks toppling down from the <lb/>precipices are so many dangers which beset his life.<lb/>  
Even his erect attitude is a continual affront to the great<lb/>  
law of gravitation, which is sometimes fatally avenged<lb/>  
when he loses the balance preserved by constant care,<lb/>  
and falls on a hard surface. The very arts on which<lb/>  
he relies for protection from the unkindness of the <lb/>elements betray him to the fate he would avoid, in some<lb/>  
moment of negligence, or by some misdirection of skill,<lb/>  
and he perishes miserably by his own inventions. Amid<lb/>  
these various causes of accidental death, which thus<lb/>  
surround us at every moment, it is only wonderful that<lb/>  
their proper effect is not oftener produced—so <lb/>admirably has the Framer of the universe adapted the <lb/>faculties by which man provides for his safety, to the perils<lb/>  
of the condition in which he is placed. Yet there are<lb/>  
situations in which all his skill and strength are vain to<lb/>  
protect him from a violent death, by some <lb/>unexpected chance which executes upon him a sentence as<lb/>  
severe and inflexible as the most pitiless tyranny of<lb/>  
human despotism. But I began with the intention of<lb/>  
relating a story, and I will not by my reflections <lb/>anticipate the catastrophe of my narrative.</p>
            <p>One pleasant summer morning a party of three <lb/>persons set out from a French settlement in the western<lb/>  
region of the United States, to visit a remarkable <lb/>cavern in its vicinity. They had already proceeded for<lb/>  
the distance of about three miles, through the tall <lb/>original forest, along a path so rarely trodden that it <lb/>required all their attention to keep its track. They now<lb/>  
perceived through the trees the sunshine at a distance,<lb/>  
and as they drew nearer they saw that it came down<lb/>
               <pb n="195"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
into a kind of natural opening, at the foot of a steep<lb/>  
precipice. At every step the vast wall seemed to rise<lb/>  
higher and higher; its seams and fissures, and <lb/>inequalities became more and more distinct; and far up,<lb/>  
nearly midway from the bottom, appeared a dark <lb/>opening, under an impending crag. The precipice seemed<lb/>  
between two and three hundred feet in height, and quite<lb/>  
perpendicular. At its base, the earth for several rods<lb/>  
around was heaped with loose fragments of rock,<lb/>  
which had evidently been detached from the principal<lb/>  
mass, and shivered to pieces in the fall. A few trees,<lb/>  
among which were the black walnut and the <lb/>slipperyelm, and here and there an oak, grew scattered among the<lb/>  
rocks, and attested by their dwarfish stature the <lb/>ungrateful soil in which they had taken root. But the<lb/>  
wild grape vines which trailed along the ground, and<lb/>  
sent out their branches to overrun the trees around<lb/>  
them, showed by their immense size how much they<lb/>  
delighted in the warmth of the rocks and the sunshine.<lb/>  
The celastrus also here and there had wound its strong<lb/>  
rings round and round the trunks and the boughs, till<lb/>  
they died in its embrace, and then clothed the leafless<lb/>  
branches in a thick drapery of its own foliage. Into<lb/>  
this open space the party at length emerged from the<lb/>  
forest, and for a moment stopped.</p>
            <p>“Yonder is the Skeleton's Cave,” said one of them,<lb/>  
who stood a little in front of the rest. As he spoke he<lb/>  
raised his arm, and pointed to the dark opening in the<lb/>  
precipice already mentioned.</p>
            <p>The speaker was an aged man, of spare figure, and<lb/>  
a mild, subdued expression of countenance. Whoever<lb/>  
looked at his thin gray hairs, his stooping form, and the<lb/>  
emaciated hand which he extended, might have taken<lb/>  
him for one who had passed the Scripture limit of <lb/>three-score years and ten; but a glance at his clear and bright<lb/>  
hazel eye would have induced the observer to set him<lb/>  
down at some five years younger. A broad-brimmed<lb/>
               <pb n="196"/>  
palmetto hat shaded his venerable features from the<lb/>  
sun, and his black gown and rosary denoted him to be<lb/>  
an ecclesiastic of the Romish faith.</p>
            <p>The two persons whom he addressed were much<lb/>  
younger. One of them was in the prime of manhood<lb/>  
and personal strength, rather tall, and of a vigorous<lb/>  
make. He wore a hunting-cap, from the lower edge<lb/>  
of which curled a profusion of strong dark hair, rather<lb/>  
too long for the usual mode in the Atlantic States, <lb/>shading a fresh-coloured countenance, lighted by a pair of<lb/>  
full black eyes, the expression of which was <lb/>compounded of boldness and good-humour. His dress<lb/>  
was a blue frock-coat trimmed with yellow fringe, and<lb/>  
bound by a sash at the waist, deer-skin pantaloons,<lb/>  
and deer-skin mocasins. He carried a short rifle on his<lb/>  
left shoulder; and wore on his left side a leathern bag<lb/>  
of rather ample dimensions, and on his right a <lb/>powder-flask. It was evident that he was either a hunter by<lb/>  
occupation, or at least one who made hunting his <lb/>principal amusement; and there was something in his air<lb/>  
and the neatness of his garb and equipments that <lb/>bespoke the latter.</p>
            <p>On the arm of this person leaned the third individual<lb/>  
of the party, a young woman apparently about nineteen<lb/>  
or twenty years of age, slender and graceful as a<lb/>  
youthful student of the classic poets might imagine a<lb/>  
wood-nymph. She was plainly attired in a straw hat<lb/>  
and a dress of russet-colour, fitted for a ramble through<lb/>  
that wild forest. The faces of her two companions<lb/>  
were decidedly French in their physiognomy; hers was<lb/>  
as decidedly Anglo-American. Her brown hair was<lb/>  
parted away from a forehead of exceeding fairness,<lb/>  
more compressed on the sides than is usual with<lb/>  
the natives of England; and showing in the <lb/>profile that approach to the Grecian outline which is <lb/>remarked among their descendants in America. To <lb/>complete the picture, imagine a quiet blue eye, features<lb/>
               <pb n="197"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
delicately moulded, and just colour enough on her cheek<lb/>  
to make it interesting to watch its changes, as it <lb/>deepened or grew paler with the varying and flitting <lb/>emotions which slight cause will call up in a youthful <lb/>maiden's bosom.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this difference of national <lb/>physiognomy, there was nothing peculiar in her accent, as she<lb/>  
answered the old man who had just spoken.</p>
            <p>“I see the mouth of the cave, but how are we to<lb/>  
reach it, Father Ambrose? I perceive no way of getting<lb/>  
to it without wings, either from the bottom or the top<lb/>  
of the precipice.”</p>
            <p>“Look a few rods to the right, Emily. Do you see<lb/>  
that pile of broken rocks reaching up to the middle of<lb/>  
the precipice, looking as if a huge column of that<lb/>  
mighty wall had been shivered into a pyramid of <lb/>fragments? Our path lies that way.”</p>
            <p>“I see it, father,” returned the fair questioner; “but<lb/>  
when we arrive at the top, it appears to me we shall be<lb/>  
no nearer the cave than we now are.”</p>
            <p>“From the top of that pile you may perceive a <lb/>horizontal seam in the precipice extending to the mouth of<lb/>  
the cave. Along that line, though you cannot discern it<lb/>  
from the place where we stand, is a safe and broad<lb/>  
footing, leading to our place of destination. Do you<lb/>  
see, Le Maire,” continued Father Ambrose, addressing<lb/>  
himself to his other companion, “do you see that eagle<lb/>  
sitting so composedly on a bough of that leafless tree,<lb/>  
which seems a mere shrub on the brow of the precipice<lb/>  
directly over the cavern? Nay, never lift your rifle,<lb/>  
my good friend; the bird is beyond your reach, and you<lb/>  
will only waste your powder. The superfluous rains<lb/>  
which fall on the highlands beyond are collected in the<lb/>  
hollow over which hangs the tree I showed you, and<lb/>  
pour down the face of the rock directly over the <lb/>entrance of the cave. Generally, you will see the bed<lb/>  
of that hollow perfectly dry, as it is at present, but<lb/>
               <pb n="198"/>  
during a violent shower, or after several days' rain, there<lb/>  
descends from that spot a sheet of water, white as<lb/>  
snow, deafening with its noise the quiet solitudes around<lb/>  
us, and rivalling in beauty some of the cascades that<lb/>  
tumble from the cliffs of the Alps. But let us proceed.”</p>
            <p>The old man led the party to the pile of rocks which<lb/>  
he had pointed out to their notice, and began to ascend<lb/>  
from one huge block to another with an agility scarcely<lb/>  
impaired by age. They could now perceive that human<lb/>  
steps had trodden that rough path before them; in<lb/>  
some places the ancient moss was effaced from the<lb/>  
stones, and in others their surfaces had been worn<lb/>  
smooth. Emily was about to follow her venerable <lb/>conductor, when Le Maire offered to assist her.</p>
            <p>“Nay, uncle,” said she, “I know you are the <lb/>politest of men, but I think your rifle will give you trouble<lb/>  
enough. I have often heard you call it your wife; so I<lb/>  
beg you will wait on Madame Le Maire, and leave me<lb/>  
to make the best of my way by myself. I am not now<lb/>  
to take my first lesson in climbing rocks, as you well<lb/>  
know.”</p>
            <p>“Well, if this rifle be my spouse,” rejoined the<lb/>  
hunter, “I will say that it is not every wife who has so<lb/>  
devoted a husband, nor every husband who is fortunate<lb/>  
enough to possess so true a wife. She has another<lb/>  
good quality—she never speaks but when she is bid,<lb/>  
and then always to the point. I only wish for your<lb/>  
sake, since I am not permitted to assist you, that Henry<lb/>  
Danville were here. I think we should see the <lb/>wildness of the paces that carry you so lightly over<lb/>  
these rocks, a little chastised, while the young <lb/>gentleman tenderly and respectfully handed you up this rude<lb/>  
staircase, too rude for such delicate feet. Ah, I beg<lb/>  
pardon, I forgot that you had quarrelled. Well, it is<lb/>  
only a lover's quarrel, and the reconciliation will be the<lb/>  
happier for being delayed so long. Henry is a worthy<lb/>  
lad and an excellent marksman.”</p>
            <pb n="199"/>
            <p/>
            <p>A heroine in a modern novel would have turned back<lb/>  
this raillery with a smart or proud reply, but Emily<lb/>  
was of too sincere and ingenuous a nature to answer a<lb/>  
jest on a subject in which her heart was so deeply <lb/>interested. Her cheek burned with a blush of the <lb/>deepest crimson, as she turned away without speaking, and<lb/>  
fled up the rocks. But though she spoke not, a tumult<lb/>  
of images and feelings passed rapidly through her<lb/>  
mind. One vivid picture of the past after another came<lb/>  
before her recollection, and one well-known form and<lb/>  
face were present in them all. She saw Henry <lb/>Danville as when she first beheld, and was struck with his<lb/>  
frank, intelligent aspect and graceful manners,—<lb/>respectful, attentive, eager to attract her notice, and <lb/>fearing to displease,—then again as the accepted and <lb/>delighted lover,—and finally, as he was now, offended,<lb/>  
coid, and estranged. A rustic ball rose before her<lb/>  
imagination—a young stranger from the Atlantic States<lb/>  
appears among the revellers—the phrases of the gay<lb/>  
and animated conversation she held with him again<lb/>  
vibrate on her ear—and again she sees Henry standing<lb/>  
aloof, and looking gloomy and unhappy. She <lb/>remembered how she had undertaken to discipline him for<lb/>  
this unreasonable jealousy, by appearing charmed with<lb/>  
her new acquaintance, and accepting his civilities with<lb/>  
affected pleasure; how he had taken fire at this—had<lb/>  
withdrawn himself from her society, and transferred<lb/>  
his attentions to others. It was but the simple history<lb/>  
of what is common enough among youthful lovers; but<lb/>  
it was not of the less moment to her whose heart now<lb/>  
throbbed with mingled pride and anguish, as these <lb/>incidents came thronging back upon her memory. She<lb/>  
regretted her own folly, but her thoughts severely<lb/>  
blamed Henry for making so trifling a matter a ground<lb/>  
of serious offence, and she sought consolation in <lb/>reflecting how unhappy she must have been had she been<lb/>  
united for life to one of so jealous a temper. “I am<lb/>
               <pb n="200"/>  
confident,” said she to herself, “that his present <lb/>indifference is all a pretence; he will soon sue for a <lb/>reconciliation, and I shall then show him that I can be as<lb/>  
indifferent as himself.”</p>
            <p>Occupied with these reflections, Emily, before she<lb/>  
was aware, found herself at the summit of that pile of<lb/>  
broken rocks, and midway up the precipice.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ecclesiastic was the first of the party who <lb/>arrived at the summit. He had seated himself on one<lb/>  
of the blocks of stone which composed the pile, with<lb/>  
his back against the wall of the precipice, and had<lb/>  
taken the hat from his brow that he might enjoy the<lb/>  
breeze which played lightly about the cliffs; and the<lb/>  
coolness of which was doubly grateful after the toil of<lb/>  
the ascent. In doing this he uncovered a high and<lb/>  
ample forehead, such as artists love to couple with the<lb/>  
features of old age, when they would represent a <lb/>countenance at once noble and venerable. This is the only<lb/>  
feature of the human face which Time spares: he dims<lb/>  
the lustre of the eye; he shrivels the cheek; he <lb/>destroys the firm or sweet expression of the mouth; he<lb/>  
thins and whitens the hairs; but the forehead, that <lb/>temple of thought, is beyond his reach, or rather, it shows<lb/>  
more grand and lofty for the ravages which surround it.</p>
            <p>The spot on which they now stood commanded a<lb/>  
view of a wide extent of uncultivated and uninhabited<lb/>  
country. An eminence interposed to hide from sight<lb/>
               <pb n="201"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
the village they had left; and on every side were<lb/>  
the summits of the boundless forest, here and there<lb/>  
diversified with a hollow of softer and richer verdure,<lb/>  
where the hurricane, a short time before, had descended<lb/>  
to lay prostrate the gigantic trees, and a young growth<lb/>  
had shot up in their stead. Solitary savannas opened<lb/>  
in the depth of the woods, and far off a lonely stream<lb/>  
was flowing away in silence, sometimes among <lb/>venerable trees, and sometimes through natural meadows,<lb/>  
crimson with blossoms. All around them was the<lb/>  
might, the majesty of vegetable life, untamed by the<lb/>  
hand of man, and pampered by the genial elements<lb/>  
into boundless luxuriance. The ecclesiastic pointed<lb/>  
out to his companions the peculiarities of the scenery;<lb/>  
he expatiated on the flowery beauty of those unshorn<lb/>  
lawns; and on the lofty growth, and the magnificence<lb/>  
and variety of foliage which distinguish the American<lb/>  
forests, so much the admiration of those who have seen<lb/>  
only the groves of Europe.</p>
            <p>The conversation was interrupted by a harsh <lb/>stridulous cry, and looking up, the party beheld the eagle who<lb/>  
had left his perch on the top of the precipice, and having<lb/>  
passed over their heads, was winging his way towards<lb/>  
the stream in the distance.</p>
            <p>“Ah,” exclaimed Le Maire, “that is a hungry note,<lb/>  
and the bird is a shrewd one, for he is steering to a<lb/>  
place where there is plenty of game to my certain<lb/>  
knowledge. It is the golden eagle; the war eagle, as<lb/>  
the Indians call him, and no chicken either, as you may<lb/>  
understand from the dark colour of his plumage. I<lb/>  
warrant he has gorged many a rabbit and prairie hen<lb/>  
on these old cliffs. At all events, he has made me think<lb/>  
of my dinner: unless we make haste, good Father <lb/>Ambrose, I am positive that we shall be late to our venison<lb/>  
and claret.”</p>
            <p>“We must endeavour to prevent so great a <lb/>misfortune,” said Father Ambrose, rising from the rock where<lb/>
               <pb n="202"/>  
he sat, and proceeding on the path towards the cavern.<lb/>  
It was a kind of narrow terrace, varying in width from<lb/>  
four to ten feet, running westwardly along the face of<lb/>  
the steep solid rock, and apparently formed by the<lb/>  
breaking away of the upper part of one of the <lb/>perpendicular strata of which the precipice was composed.<lb/>  
That event must have happened at a very remote<lb/>  
period, for in some places the earth had accumulated on<lb/>  
the path to a considerable depth, and here and there<lb/>  
grew a hardy and dwarfish shrub, or a tuft of <lb/>wild-flowers hanging over the edge. As they proceeded, the<lb/>  
great height at which they stood, and the steepness of<lb/>  
the rocky wall above and below them, made Emily<lb/>  
often tremble and grow pale as she looked down. A<lb/>  
few rods brought the party to a turn in the rock, where<lb/>  
the path was narrower than elsewhere, and precisely<lb/>  
in the angle a portion of the terrace on which they<lb/>  
walked had fallen, leaving a chasm of about two feet<lb/>  
in width, through which their distance from the base<lb/>  
was fearfully apparent. Le Maire had already passed<lb/>  
it, but Emily, when she arrived at the spot, shrunk back<lb/>  
and leaned against the rock.</p>
            <p>“I fear I shall not be able to cross the chasm,” said<lb/>  
she, in a tone of alarm. “My poor head grows giddy<lb/>  
from a single look at it.”</p>
            <p>“Le Maire will assist you, my child,” said the old<lb/>  
man, who walked behind her.</p>
            <p>“With the greatest pleasure in-life,” answered Le<lb/>  
Maire; “though I confess I little expected that the<lb/>  
daughter of a clear-headed Yankee would complain of<lb/>  
being giddy in any situation. But this comes of having<lb/>  
a French mother I suppose. Let me provide a <lb/>convenient station for Madame le Maire, as you call her, and<lb/>  
I will help you over.” He then placed his rifle against<lb/>  
the rock, where the path immediately beyond him grew<lb/>  
wider, and advancing to the edge of the chasm, held<lb/>  
forth both hands to Emily, taking hold of her arms near<lb/>
               <pb n="203"/>  
the elbow. In doing this he perceived that she<lb/>  
trembled.</p>
            <p>“You are as safe here as when you were in the<lb/>  
woods below,” said Le Maire, “if you would but think<lb/>  
so. Step forward now, firmly, and look neither to the<lb/>  
right nor left.”</p>
            <p>She took the step, but at that moment the strange<lb/>  
inclination which we sometimes feel when standing on<lb/>  
a dizzy height, to cast ourselves to the ground, came<lb/>  
powerfully over her, and she leaned involuntarily and<lb/>  
heavily towards the verge of the precipice. Le Maire<lb/>  
was instantly aware of the movement, and bracing <lb/>himself firmly, strove with all his might to counteract it.<lb/>  
Had his grasp been less steady, or his self-possession<lb/>  
less perfect, they would both inevitably have been <lb/>precipitated from where they stood; but Le Maire was<lb/>  
familiar with all the perilous situations of the <lb/>wilderness, and the presence of mind he had learned in<lb/>  
such a school did not now desert him. His <lb/>countenance bore witness to the intense exertion he was<lb/>  
making; it was flushed, and its muscles were working<lb/>  
powerfully; his lips were closely compressed; the<lb/>  
veins on his brow swelled, and his arms quivered with<lb/>  
the strong tension given to their sinews. For an instant<lb/>  
the fate of the two seemed in suspense, but the strength<lb/>  
of the hunter prevailed, and he placed the damsel <lb/>beside him on the rock, fainting and pallid as a corpse.</p>
            <p>“God be praised,” said the priest, drawing heavily<lb/>  
the breath which he had involuntarily held during that<lb/>  
fearful moment, while he had watched the scene, unable<lb/>  
to render the least assistance.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Some</hi> moments of repose were necessary before<lb/>  
Emily was sufficiently recovered from her agitation to<lb/>  
be able to proceed. The tears filled her eyes as she<lb/>  
briefly but warmly thanked Le Maire for his generous<lb/>  
exertions to save her, and begged his pardon for the <lb/>foolish and awkward timidity, as she termed it, which had<lb/>  
put his life as well as her own in such extreme peril.</p>
            <p>“I confess,” answered he, good-naturedly, “that had<lb/>  
you been of as solid a composition as some ladies with<lb/>  
whom I have the honour of an acquaintance, Madame<lb/>  
Le Maire here would most certainly have been a<lb/>  
widow. I understood my own strength, however,”<lb/>  
added he, for on this point he was somewhat vain,<lb/>  
“and if I had not, I should still have been willing to risk<lb/>  
something rather than to lose you. But I will take<lb/>  
care, Emily, that you do not lead me into another scrape<lb/>  
of the kind. When we return I shall, by your leave,<lb/>  
take you in my arms and carry you over the chasm,<lb/>  
and you may shut your eyes while I do it, if you<lb/>  
please.”</p>
            <p>They now again set out, and in a few moments arrived<lb/>  
at the mouth of the cavern they had come to visit. A<lb/>
               <pb n="205"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
projecting mass of rock impended over it, so low as not<lb/>  
to allow in front an entrance to a person standing <lb/>upright, but on each side it receded upwards in such a<lb/>  
manner as to leave two high narrow openings, giving<lb/>  
it the appearance of being suspended from the cavern<lb/>  
roof. Beneath it the floor, which was a continuation of<lb/>  
the terrace leading to the spot, was covered, in places,<lb/>  
to a considerable depth, with soil formed by the <lb/>disintegration of the neighbouring rocks, and traversed by<lb/>  
several fissures nearly filled with earth. As they <lb/>entered by one of the narrow side openings, Emily looked<lb/>  
up to the crag with a slight shudder. “If it should<lb/>  
fall!” thought she to herself; but a feeling of shame at<lb/>  
the idle fear she had lately manifested restrained her<lb/>  
from giving utterance to the thought. The good <lb/>ecclesiastic perceived what was passing in her mind, and<lb/>  
said, with a smile—</p>
            <p>“There is no danger, my child; that rock has been<lb/>  
suspended over the entrance for centuries, for <lb/>thousands of years perhaps, and is not likely to fall <lb/>today. Ages must have elapsed before the crags could<lb/>  
have crumbled to form the soil now under our feet.<lb/>  
It is true that there is no place sacred from the <lb/>intrusion of accident; everywhere may unforeseen events<lb/>  
surprise and crush us, as the foot of man surprises and<lb/>  
crushes the insect in his path; but to suppose peculiar<lb/>  
danger in a place which has known no change for <lb/>hundreds of years is to distrust Providence. Come, Le<lb/>  
Maire,’ said Father Ambrose, “will you oblige us by<lb/>  
striking a light? Our eyes have been too much in the<lb/>  
sunshine to distinguish objects in this dark place.”</p>
            <p>Le Maire produced from his hunting bag a roll of<lb/>  
tinder, and lighting it with a spark from his rifle, kindled<lb/>  
in a few moments a large pitch-pine torch. The <lb/>circumstance which first struck the attention of the party<lb/>  
was the profound and solemn stillness of the place.<lb/>  
The most quiet day has under the open sky its <lb/>
               <pb n="206"/>multitude of sounds—the lapse of waters, the subtle motions<lb/>  
of the apparently slumbering air among forests, grasses,<lb/>  
and rocks, the flight and note of insects, the voices of<lb/>  
animals, the rising of exhalations, the mighty process<lb/>  
of change, of perpetual growth and decay, going on all<lb/>  
over the earth, produce a chorus of noises which the<lb/>  
hearing cannot analyze—which, though it may seem to<lb/>  
you silence, is not so; and when from such a scene<lb/>  
you pass directly into one of the rocky chambers of the<lb/>  
earth, you perceive your error by the contrast. As the<lb/>  
three went forward they passed through a heap of dry<lb/>  
leaves lightly piled, which the winds of the last autumn<lb/>  
had blown into the cave from the summit of the <lb/>surrounding forest, and the rustling made by their steps<lb/>  
sounded strangely loud amid that death-like silence.<lb/>  
A spacious cavern presented itself to their sight, the<lb/>  
roof of which near the entrance was low, but several<lb/>  
paces beyond it rose to a great height, where the smoke<lb/>  
of the torch ascending, mingled with the darkness, but<lb/>  
the flame did not reveal the face of the vault.</p>
            <p>They soon came to where, as Father Ambrose <lb/>informed them, the cave divided into two branches.<lb/>  
“That on the left,” said he, “soon becomes a low and<lb/>  
narrow passage among the rocks; this on the right<lb/>  
leads to a large chamber, in which lie the bones from<lb/>  
which the cavern takes its name.”</p>
            <p>He now took the torch from the hand of Le Maire,<lb/>  
and turning to the right guided his companions to a<lb/>  
lofty and wide apartment of the cave, in one corner of<lb/>  
which he showed them a human skeleton lying <lb/>extended on the rocky floor. Some decayed fragments,<lb/>  
apparently of the skins of animals, lay under it in places,<lb/>  
and one small remnant passed over the thighs, but<lb/>  
the bones, though they had acquired from the <lb/>atmosphere of the cave a greenish yellow hue, were <lb/>seemingly unmouldered. They still retained their original<lb/>  
relative position, and appeared as never disturbed since<lb/>  
the sleep of death came over the frame to which they<lb/>
               <pb n="207"/>  
once belonged. Emily gazed on the spectacle with<lb/>  
that natural horror which the remains of the dead <lb/>inspire. Even Le Maire, with all his vivacity and <lb/>garrulity, was silent for a moment.</p>
            <p>“Is any thing known of the manner in which this<lb/>  
poor wretch came to his end?” he at length inquired.</p>
            <p>“Nothing. The name of Skeleton's Cave was given<lb/>  
to this place by the aborigines; but I believe they have<lb/>  
no tradition concerning these remains. If you look at<lb/>  
the right leg you will perceive that the bone is <lb/>fractured: it is most likely the man was wounded on these<lb/>  
very cliffs either by accident or by some enemy, and<lb/>  
that he crawled to this retreat, where he perished from<lb/>  
want of attendance and from famine.”</p>
            <p>“What a death!” murmured Emily.</p>
            <p>The ecclesiastic then directed their attention to <lb/>another part of the same chamber, where he said it was<lb/>  
formerly not uncommon for persons benighted in these<lb/>  
parts, particularly hunters, to pass the night. “You<lb/>  
perceive,” added he, “that this spot is higher than the<lb/>  
rest of the cavern, and drier also; indeed no part of<lb/>  
the cavern is much subject to moisture. A bed of<lb/>  
leaves on this rock with a good blanket, is no bad <lb/>accommodation for a night's rest, as I can assure you,<lb/>  
having once made the experiment myself many years<lb/>  
since, when I came hither from Europe. Ah, what have<lb/>  
we here? coals, brands, splinters of pitch-pine! The<lb/>  
cave must have been occupied very lately for the <lb/>purpose I mentioned, and by people too who, I dare say,<lb/>  
from the preparations they seem to have made, passed<lb/>  
the night very comfortably.”</p>
            <p>“I dare say they did so, though they had an ugly<lb/>  
bedfellow yonder,” answered Le Maire; “but I hope<lb/>  
you do not think of following their example. As you<lb/>  
have shown us, I presume, the principal curiosities of<lb/>  
the cave, I take the liberty of suggesting the propriety<lb/>  
of getting as fast as we can out of this melancholy<lb/>
               <pb n="208"/>  
place, which has already put me out of spirits. That<lb/>  
poor wretch who died of famine!—I shall never get<lb/>  
him out of my head till I am fairly set down to dinner.<lb/>  
Not that I care more for my dinner than any other man<lb/>  
when there is any thing of importance in the way, as,<lb/>  
for example, a buffalo, or a fat buck, or a bear to be<lb/>  
killed; but you will allow, Father Ambrose, that a<lb/>  
saddle of venison, or a hump of buffalo and a sober<lb/>  
bottle of claret are a prettier spectacle, particularly at<lb/>  
this time of day, than that mouldy skeleton yonder. I<lb/>  
had intended to shoot something in my way back just<lb/>  
to keep my hand and eye in practice, but it is quite too<lb/>  
late to think of that. Besides, here is Emily, poor<lb/>  
thing, whom we have contrived to get up to this place,<lb/>  
and whom we must manage to get down again as well<lb/>  
as we can.”</p>
            <p>The good priest, though by no means participating<lb/>  
in Le Maire's haste to be gone, mildly yielded to his<lb/>  
instances, particularly as they were seconded by Emily,<lb/>  
and they accordingly prepared to return. On reaching<lb/>  
the mouth of the cave, they were struck with the change<lb/>  
in the aspect of the heavens. Dark heavy clouds, the<lb/>  
round summits of which were seen one beyond the<lb/>  
other, were rapidly rising in the west; and through<lb/>  
the grayish blue haze which suffused the sky before<lb/>  
them, the sun appeared already shorn of his beams.<lb/>  
A sound was heard afar of mighty winds contending<lb/>  
with the forest, and the thunder rolled at a distance.</p>
            <p>“We must stay at least until the storm is over,” said<lb/>  
Father Ambrose; “it would be upon us before we<lb/>  
could descend these cliffs. Let us watch it from where<lb/>  
we stand above the tops of these old woods: I can<lb/>  
promise you it will be a magnificent spectacle.”</p>
            <p>Emily, though she would gladly have left the cave,<lb/>  
could say nothing against the propriety of this advice;<lb/>  
and even Le Maire, notwithstanding that he declared<lb/>  
he had rather see a well-loaded table at that moment<lb/>
               <pb n="209"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
than all the storms that ever blew, preferred remaining<lb/>  
to the manifest inconvenience of attempting a descent.<lb/>  
In a few moments the dark array of clouds swept over<lb/>  
the face of the sun, and a tumult in the woods <lb/>announced the coming of the blast. The summits of the<lb/>  
forest waved and stooped before it, like a field of young<lb/>  
flax in the summer breeze,—another and fiercer gust<lb/>  
descended,—another and stronger convulsion of the<lb/>  
forest ensued. The trees rocked backward and <lb/>forward, leaned and rose, and tossed and swung their<lb/>  
branches in every direction, and the whirling air above<lb/>  
them was filled with their leafy spoils. The roar was<lb/>  
tremendous,—the noise of the ocean in a tempest is<lb/>  
not louder,—it seemed as if that innumerable <lb/>multitude of giants of the wood, raised a universal voice of<lb/>  
wailing under the fury that smote and tormented them.<lb/>  
At length the rain began to fall, first in large and rare<lb/>  
drops, and then the thunder burst over head, and the<lb/>  
waters of the firmament poured down in torrents, and<lb/>  
the blast that howled in the woods fled before them as<lb/>  
if from an element that it feared. The trees again<lb/>  
stood erect, and nothing was heard but the rain beating<lb/>  
heavily on the immense canopy of leaves around, and<lb/>  
the occasional crashings of the thunder, accompanied<lb/>  
by flashes of lightning, that threw a vivid light upon<lb/>  
the walls of the cavern. The priest and his companions<lb/>  
stood contemplating this scene in silence, when a <lb/>rushing of water close at hand was heard. Father <lb/>Ambrose showed the others where a stream, formed from<lb/>  
the rains collected on the highlands above, descended<lb/>  
on the crag that overhung the mouth of the cavern,<lb/>  
and shooting clear of the rocks on which they stood,<lb/>  
fell in spray to the broken fragments at the base of the<lb/>  
precipice.</p>
            <p>A gust of wind drove the rain into the opening where<lb/>  
they stood, and obliged them to retire farther within.<lb/>  
The priest suggested that they should take this <lb/>
               <pb n="210"/>opportunity to examine that part of the cave which in going to<lb/>  
the skeleton's chamber they had passed on their left, <lb/>observing, however, that he believed it was no otherwise<lb/>  
remarkable than for its narrowness and its length. Le<lb/>  
Maire and Emily assented, and the former taking up the<lb/>  
torch which he had stuck in the ground, they went back<lb/>  
into the interior. They had just reached the spot where<lb/>  
the two passages diverged from each other, when a<lb/>  
hideous and intense glare of light filled the cavern,<lb/>  
showing for an instant the walls, the roof, the floor,<lb/>  
and every crag and recess, with the distinctness of the<lb/>  
broadest sunshine. A frightful crash accompanied it,<lb/>  
consisting of several sharp and deafening explosions,<lb/>  
as if the very heart of the mountain was rent asunder<lb/>  
by the lightning, and immediately after a body of <lb/>immense weight seemed to fall at their very feet with a<lb/>  
heavy sound, and a shock that caused the place where<lb/>  
they stood to tremble as if shaken by an earthquake.<lb/>  
A strong blast of air rushed by them, and a suffocating<lb/>  
odour filled the cavern.</p>
            <p>Father Ambrose had fallen upon his knees in mental<lb/>  
prayer, at the explosion; but the blast from the mouth<lb/>  
of the cavern threw him to the earth. He raised <lb/>himself, however, immediately, and found himself in utter<lb/>  
silence and darkness, save that a livid image of that<lb/>  
insufferable glare floated yet before his eyeballs. He<lb/>  
called first upon Emily, who did not answer, then upon<lb/>  
Le Maire, who replied from the ground a few paces<lb/>  
nearer the entrance of the cave. He also had been<lb/>  
thrown prostrate, and the torch he carried was <lb/>extinguished. It was but the work of an instant to kindle<lb/>  
it again, and they then discovered Emily extended near<lb/>  
them in a swoon.</p>
            <p>“Let us bear her to the mouth of the cavern,” said<lb/>  
Le Maire; “the fresh air from without will revive her.”<lb/>  
He took her in his arms, but on arriving at the spot he<lb/>  
placed her suddenly on the ground, and raising both<lb/>
               <pb n="211"/>  
hands, exclaimed, with an accent of despair, “The rock<lb/>  
is fallen!—the entrance is closed!”</p>
            <p>It was but too evident,—Father Ambrose needed but<lb/>  
a single look to convince him of its truth,—the huge<lb/>  
rock which impended over the entrance had been <lb/>loosened by the thunderbolt, and had fallen upon the floor<lb/>  
of the cave, closing all return to the outer world.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Before</hi> inquiring further into the extent of the <lb/>disaster, an office of humanity was to be performed.<lb/>  
Emily was yet lying on the floor of the cave in a<lb/>  
swoon, and the old man, stooping down and placing her<lb/>  
head in his lap, began to use the ordinary means of<lb/>  
recovery, and called on Le Maire to assist him. The<lb/>  
hunter, after being spoken to several times, started<lb/>  
from his gloomy revery, and kneeling down by the side<lb/>  
of the priest, aided him in chafing her temples and<lb/>  
hands, and fanned her cheek with his cap until <lb/>consciousness was restored, when the priest communicated<lb/>  
the terrible intelligence of what had happened.</p>
            <p>Presence of mind and fortitude do not always dwell<lb/>  
together. Those who are most easily overcome by the<lb/>  
appearance of danger often support the calamity after<lb/>  
it has fallen with the most composure. Le Maire had<lb/>  
presence of mind, but he had not learned to submit<lb/>
               <pb n="212"/>  
with patience to irremediable misfortune; Emily could<lb/>  
not command her nerves in sudden peril, but she could<lb/>  
suffer with a firmness which left her mind at liberty to<lb/>  
employ its resources. The very disaster which had<lb/>  
happened seemed to inspire both her mind and her<lb/>  
frame with new strength. The vague apprehensions<lb/>  
which had haunted her were now reduced to certainty;<lb/>  
she saw the extent of the calamity, and felt the duties<lb/>  
it imposed. She rose from the ground without aid and<lb/>  
with a composed countenance, and began to confer with<lb/>  
Father Ambrose on the probabilities and means of<lb/>  
escape from their present situation.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Le Maire, who had left them as<lb/>  
soon as Emily came to herself, was eagerly employed<lb/>  
in examining the entrance where the rock had fallen.<lb/>  
On one side it lay close against the wall of the cavern;<lb/>  
on the other was an opening of about a hand's breadth,<lb/>  
which appeared, so far as he could distinguish, to <lb/>communicate with the outer atmosphere. He looked above,<lb/>  
but there the low roof, which met the wavering flame<lb/>  
of his torch, showed a collection of large blocks firmly<lb/>  
wedged together; he cast his eyes downwards, but there<lb/>  
the lower edge of the vast mass which had fallen lay<lb/>  
imbedded in the soil; he placed his shoulder against it<lb/>  
and exerted his utmost strength to discover if it were<lb/>  
moveable, but it yielded no more than the rock on which<lb/>  
it rested.</p>
            <p>“It is all over with us,” said he, at length, dashing<lb/>  
to the ground the torch, which the priest, approaching,<lb/>  
prudently took up before it was extinguished; “it is all<lb/>  
over with us; and we must perish in this horrid place<lb/>  
like wild beasts in a trap. There is no opening, no<lb/>  
possible way for escape, and not a soul on the wide<lb/>  
earth knows where we are, or what is our situation.”<lb/>  
Then turning fiercely to the priest, and losing his<lb/>  
habitual respect for his person and office in the <lb/>bitterness of his despair, he said, “This is all your doing,—<lb/>
               <pb n="213"/>  
it was you who decoyed us hither to lay our bones <lb/>beside those of that savage yonder”</p>
            <p>“My son—” said the old man.</p>
            <p>“Call me not son,—this is no time for cant. You<lb/>  
take my life, and when I reproach you, you give me<lb/>  
fine words. You call yourself a man of God,—can<lb/>  
you pray us out of this horrible dungeon into which you<lb/>  
have enticed us to bury us alive?”</p>
            <p>“Say not that I take your life,” said Father <lb/>Ambrose mildly, without otherwise noticing his reproaches;<lb/>  
“there is no reason as yet to suppose our case <lb/>hopeless. Though we informed no person of the place to<lb/>  
which we were going, it does not follow that we shall<lb/>  
not be missed, or that no inquiry will be made for us.<lb/>  
With to-morrow morning the whole settlement will<lb/>  
doubtless be out to search for us, and as it is probable<lb/>  
that some of them will pass this way, we may make<lb/>  
ourselves heard by them from the mouth of the cavern.<lb/>  
Besides, as Emily has just suggested, it is not <lb/>impossible that the cave may have some other outlet, and<lb/>  
that the part we were about to examine may afford a<lb/>  
passage to the daylight.”</p>
            <p>Le Maire caught eagerly at the hope thus presented.<lb/>  
“I beg your pardon, father,” said he, “I was hasty—<lb/>  
I was furious—but it is terrible, you will allow, to be<lb/>  
shut up in this sepulchre, with the stone rolled to its<lb/>  
mouth, and left to die. It is no light trial of patience<lb/>  
merely to pass the night here, particularly,” said he,<lb/>  
with a smile, “when you know that dinner is waiting<lb/>  
for you at home. Well, if the cave is to be explored,<lb/>  
let us set about it immediately; if there is any way of<lb/>  
getting out, let us discover it as soon as possible.”</p>
            <p>They again went to the passage which diverged from<lb/>  
the path leading to the skeleton's chamber. It was a<lb/>  
low, irregular passage, sometimes so narrow that they<lb/>  
were obliged to walk one behind the other, and <lb/>sometimes wide enough to permit them to walk abreast.<lb/>
               <pb n="214"/>  
After proceeding a few rods it became so low that they<lb/>  
were obliged to stoop.</p>
            <p>“Remain here,” said Le Maire, “and give me the<lb/>  
torch. If there be any way of reaching daylight by<lb/>  
this part of the cavern, I will give an account of<lb/>  
it in due time.”</p>
            <p>Father Ambrose and Emily then seated themselves<lb/>  
on a low bench of stone in the side of the cavern, while<lb/>  
he went forward. The gleam of his torch appearing<lb/>  
and disappearing showed the windings of the passage<lb/>  
he was treading, and sometimes the sound of measured<lb/>  
steps on the rock announced that he was walking <lb/>upright, and sometimes a confused and struggling noise<lb/>  
denoted that he was making his way on his elbows<lb/>  
and knees. At length the sound was heard no longer,<lb/>  
and the gleam of the torch ceased altogether to be <lb/>descried in the passage.</p>
            <p>“Father Ambrose!” said Emily, after a long <lb/>interval. These words, though in the lowest key of her<lb/>  
voice, were uttered in such a tone of awe, and sounded,<lb/>  
moreover, with such an unnatural distinctness in the<lb/>  
midst of that perfect stillness, that the good father<lb/>  
started.</p>
            <p>“What would you, my daughter?”</p>
            <p>“This darkness and this silence are frightful, and I<lb/>  
spoke that you might reassure me by the sound of your<lb/>  
voice. My uncle is long in returning.”</p>
            <p>“The passage is a long and intricate one.”</p>
            <p>“But is there no danger? I have heard of <lb/>death-damps in pits and deep caverns, by the mere breathing<lb/>  
of which a man dies silently and without a struggle.<lb/>  
If my poor uncle should never return!”</p>
            <p>“Let us not afflict ourselves with supposable evils,<lb/>  
while a real calamity is impending over us. The <lb/>cavern has been explored to a considerable distance <lb/>without any such consequence as you mention to those who<lb/>  
undertook it.”</p>
            <pb n="215"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“God grant that he may discover a passage out of<lb/>  
the cave! But I am afraid of the effect of a <lb/>disappointment, he is so impatient—so impetuous.”</p>
            <p>“God grant us all grace to submit to his good<lb/>  
pleasure,” rejoined the priest; “but I think I hear him<lb/>  
on the return. Listen, my child, you can distinguish<lb/>  
sounds inaudible to my dull ears.”</p>
            <p>Emily listened, but in vain. At length, after another<lb/>  
long interval, a sound of steps was heard, seemingly<lb/>  
at a vast distance. In a little while a faint light showed<lb/>  
itself in the passage, and after some minutes Le Maire<lb/>  
appeared, panting with exertion, his face covered with<lb/>  
perspiration, and his clothes soiled with the dust and<lb/>  
slime of the rocks. He was about to throw himself<lb/>  
on the rocky seat beside them without speaking.</p>
            <p>“I fear your search has been unsuccessful,” said<lb/>  
Father Ambrose.</p>
            <p>“There is no outlet in that quarter,” rejoined Le<lb/>  
Maire sullenly. “I have explored every winding and<lb/>  
every cranny of the passage, and have been brought<lb/>  
up at last, in every instance, against the solid rock.”</p>
            <p>“There is no alternative, then,” said the ecclesiastic,<lb/>  
“but to make ourselves as tranquil and comfortable as<lb/>  
we can for the night. I shall have the honour of <lb/>installing you in my old bed-chamber, where, if you sleep<lb/>  
as soundly as I did once, you will acknowledge <lb/>to-morrow morning that you might have passed a worse night.<lb/>  
It is true, Emily, that one corner of it is occupied by<lb/>  
an ill-looking inmate, but I can promise you from my<lb/>  
own experience that he will do you no harm. So let<lb/>  
us adjourn to the skeleton's chamber, and leave to<lb/>  
Providence the events of the morrow.”</p>
            <p>To the skeleton's chamber they went accordingly,<lb/>  
taking the precaution to remove thither a quantity of<lb/>  
the dry leaves which lay heaped not far from the mouth<lb/>  
of the cave, to form couches for their night's repose.<lb/>  
A log of wood of considerable size was found in this<lb/>
               <pb n="216"/>  
part of the cavern, apparently left there by those who<lb/>  
had lately occupied it for the night; and on collecting<lb/>  
the brands and bits of wood which lay scattered about<lb/>  
they found themselves in possession of a respectable<lb/>  
stock of fuel. A fire was kindled, and the warmth, the<lb/>  
light, the crackling brands, and the ever-moving flames,<lb/>  
with the dancing shadows they threw on the walls, and the<lb/>  
waving trains of smoke that mounted like winged <lb/>serpents to the roof and glided away to the larger and<lb/>  
loftier apartment of the cave, gave to that recess lately so<lb/>  
still, dark, and damp, a kind of wild cheerfulness and<lb/>  
animation, which, under other circumstances, could not<lb/>  
have failed to raise the spirits of the party. They<lb/>  
placed themselves around that rude hearth, Emily <lb/>taking care to turn her back to the corner where lay the<lb/>  
skeleton. Father Ambrose had been educated in <lb/>Europe; he had seen much of men and manners, and he<lb/>  
now exerted himself to entertain his companions by the<lb/>  
narrative of what had fallen under his observation in<lb/>  
that ancient abode of civilized man. He was <lb/>successful, and the little circle forget for a while in the charm<lb/>  
of his conversation their misfortune and their danger.<lb/>  
Even Le Maire was enticed into relating one or two<lb/>  
of his hunting exploits, and Emily suffered a few of<lb/>  
the arch sallies that distinguished her in more cheerful<lb/>  
moments to escape her. At length Le Maire's hunting<lb/>  
watch pointed to the hour of ten, and the good priest<lb/>  
counselled them to seek repose. He gave them his<lb/>  
blessing, recommending them to the great Preserver of<lb/>  
men, and then laying themselves down on their beds<lb/>  
of leaves around the fire, they endeavoured to compose<lb/>  
themselves to rest.</p>
            <p>But now that each was left to the companionship of<lb/>  
his own thoughts, the idea of their situation intruded<lb/>  
upon their minds with a sense of pain and anxiety<lb/>  
which repulsed the blessing of sleep. The reflections<lb/>  
of each on the events of the day and the prospects of<lb/>
               <pb n="217"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
the morrow were different; those of Emily were the<lb/>  
most cheerful, as her hopes of deliverance were the<lb/>  
most sanguine. Her imagination had formed a picture<lb/>  
of the incidents of her rescue from the fate that <lb/>threatened her, a little romance in anticipation, which she<lb/>  
would not for the world have revealed to living ear,<lb/>  
but which she dwelt upon fondly and perpetually in the<lb/>  
secrecy of her own meditations. She thought what<lb/>  
must be the effect of her mysterious absence from the<lb/>  
village upon Henry Danville, whose very jealousy,<lb/>  
causeless as it was, demonstrated the sincerity and<lb/>  
depth of his affection. She represented him to herself<lb/>  
as the leader in the search that would be set on foot<lb/>  
for the lost ones, as the most adventurous of the band,<lb/>  
the most persevering, the most inventive, and the most<lb/>  
successful.</p>
            <p>“He will pass by this precipice to-morrow,” thought<lb/>  
she; “like others, he has heard of this cave; he will<lb/>  
see that the fall of the rock has closed the entrance,<lb/>  
his quick apprehension will divine the place of our <lb/>imprisonment, he will call upon those who are engaged<lb/>  
in the search, he will climb the precipice, he will <lb/>deliver us, and I shall forgive him. But should it be my<lb/>  
fate to perish; should none ever know the manner and<lb/>  
place of my death; there will be one at least who will<lb/>  
remember and regret me. He will bitterly repent the<lb/>  
wrong he has done me, and the tears will start into his<lb/>  
eyes at the mention of my name.” A tear gushed out<lb/>  
from between the closed lids of the fair girl as this<lb/>  
thought passed through her mind, but it was such a<lb/>  
tear as maidens love to shed, and it did not delay the<lb/>  
slumber that already began to steal over her.</p>
            <p>Sleep was later in visiting the eyes of Le Maire.<lb/>  
The impatience which a bold and adventurous man,<lb/>  
accustomed to rely on his own activity and address for<lb/>  
escape in perilous emergencies, feels under the pressure<lb/>  
of a calamity which no exertion of his own can remedy,<lb/>
               <pb n="218"/>  
had chafed and almost maddened his spirit. His heart<lb/>  
sank within him at the thought of the lingering death<lb/>  
he must die if not liberated from his living tomb. Long<lb/>  
and uneasily he tossed on his bed of leaves, but he too<lb/>  
had his hopes of deliverance by the people of the <lb/>village, who would unquestionably assemble in the <lb/>morning to search for their lost neighbours, and who might<lb/>  
discover their situation. These thoughts at length <lb/>prevailed over those of a gloomier kind; and the fatigues of<lb/>  
the day overcoming his eyes with drowsiness, he fell<lb/>  
into a slumber, profound, as it seemed from his <lb/>hard-drawn breath, but uneasy and filled with unpleasant<lb/>  
dreams, as was evident from frequent starts and <lb/>muttered exclamations.</p>
            <p>When it was certain that both were asleep, Father<lb/>  
Ambrose raised himself from his place and regarded<lb/>  
them sorrowfully and attentively. He had not slept,<lb/>  
though from his motionless posture and closed eyes, an<lb/>  
observer might have thought him buried in a deep <lb/>slumber. His own apprehensions, notwithstanding that he<lb/>  
had endeavoured to prevent his companions from <lb/>yielding themselves up to despair, were more painful than<lb/>  
he had permitted himself to utter. That there was a<lb/>  
possibility of their deliverance was true, but it was<lb/>  
hardly to be expected that those who sought for them<lb/>  
would think of looking for them in the cavern, nor was<lb/>  
it likely that any cry they could utter would be heard<lb/>  
below. The old man's thoughts gradually formed<lb/>  
themselves into a kind of soliloquy, uttered, as is often<lb/>  
the case with men much given to solitary meditation<lb/>  
and prayer, in a low but articulate voice. “For <lb/>myself,” said he, “my life is near its close, and the day<lb/>  
of decrepitude may be even yet nearer than the day of<lb/>  
death. I repine not, if it be the will of God that my<lb/>  
existence on earth, already mercifully protracted to the<lb/>  
ordinary limits of usefulness, should end here. But<lb/>  
my heart bleeds to think that this maiden, in the <lb/>
               <pb n="219"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>blossom of her beauty and in the spring-time of her hopes,<lb/>  
and that he who slumbers near me, in the pride and<lb/>  
strength of manhood, should be thus violently divorced<lb/>  
from a life which nature perhaps intended for as long<lb/>  
a date as mine. I little thought, when the mother of<lb/>  
that fair young creature in dying committed her to my<lb/>  
charge, that I should be her guide to a place where she<lb/>  
should meet with a frightful and unnatural death. <lb/>Accustomed as I am to protracted fastings, it is not <lb/>impossible that I may outlive them both, and after having<lb/>  
closed their eyes, who should have closed mine, I may<lb/>  
be delivered and go forth in my uselessness from the<lb/>  
sepulchre of those who should have been the delight<lb/>  
and support of their friends. Let it not displease thee,<lb/>  
O, my Maker! if, like the patriarch of old, I venture<lb/>  
to expostulate with thee.” And the old man placed<lb/>  
himself in an attitude of supplication, clasping his hands<lb/>  
and raising them towards heaven. Long did he remain<lb/>  
in that posture motionless, and at length lowering his<lb/>  
hands, he cast a look upon the sleepers near him, and<lb/>  
laying himself down upon his bed of leaves, was soon<lb/>  
asleep also.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Of</hi> course the slumbers of none of the party were<lb/>  
long protracted. They were early dispersed by the<lb/>  
idea of their imprisonment in that mountain dungeon,<lb/>  
which now and then showed itself painfully in the<lb/>  
imagery of their dreams. When Emily awoke she<lb/>  
found herself alone in the skeleton's chamber. Her<lb/>  
eyes, accustomed to the darkness, could now <lb/>distinguish most of the objects around her by the help of a<lb/>  
gleam of light, which appeared to come in from the<lb/>  
larger apartment. The fire, kindled the night previous,<lb/>  
was now a mass of ashes and blackened brands; and<lb/>  
the couches of her two companions yet showed the<lb/>  
pressure of their forms. She rose, and not without<lb/>  
casting a look at the grim inmate of the place, whose<lb/>  
discoloured bones were just distinguishable in that dim<lb/>  
twilight, passed into the outer chamber. Here she<lb/>  
found the priest and Le Maire standing near the mouth<lb/>  
of the cavern, where a strong light, at least so it seemed<lb/>  
to her eyes, streamed in through the opening between<lb/>  
the well and the fallen rock, showing that the short<lb/>  
night of summer was already past.</p>
            <p>“We are watching the increasing light of the <lb/>morning,” said the priest.</p>
            <p>“And waiting for the friends whom it will bring to<lb/>  
deliver us,” added Le Maire.</p>
            <pb n="221"/>
            <p/>
            <milestone unit="collation"/>
            <p>“You will admit me to share in the occupation, I<lb/>  
hope,” answered Emily. “I am fit for nothing else,<lb/>  
as you know, but to watch and wait, and I will <lb/>endeavour to do that patiently.”</p>
            <p>It was not long before a brighter and a steady light,<lb/>  
through the aperture, informed the prisoners that the<lb/>  
sun had risen over the forest tops; and that the perfect<lb/>  
day now shone upon the earth. To those, who could<lb/>  
look upon the woods and savannas, the hills and the<lb/>  
waters around, that morning was one of the most <lb/>beautiful of the beautiful season to which it belonged. The<lb/>  
aspect of nature, like one of those human countenances<lb/>  
we sometimes meet with, so radiant with cheerfulness<lb/>  
that it seems as if they had never known the <lb/>expression of sorrow, showed, in the gladness it now put on,<lb/>  
no traces of the tempest of the preceding day. The<lb/>  
intensity of the sun's light was tempered by the white<lb/>  
clouds that now and then floated over it, trailing through<lb/>  
a soft blue sky; and the light and fresh breezes seemed<lb/>  
to hover in the air, to rise and descend, with a motion<lb/>  
like the irregular and capricious course of the <lb/>butterfly; now stooping to wrinkle the surface of the stream,<lb/>  
now rising to murmur in the leaves of the forest, and<lb/>  
again descending to shake the dew from the cups of<lb/>  
the opening flowers in the natural meadows. The <lb/>replenished brooks had a livelier warble, and the notes<lb/>  
of innumerable birds rang more cheerfully through the<lb/>  
clear atmosphere. The prisoners of the cavern, however,<lb/>  
could only distinguish the beauty of the morning by<lb/>  
slight tokens,—now and then a sweep of the winds<lb/>  
over the forest tops—sometimes the note of the <lb/>wood-thrush, or of the cardinal bird as he flew by the face<lb/>  
of the rocks; and occasionally a breath of the<lb/>  
perfumed atmosphere flowing through the aperture.<lb/>  
These intimations of liberty and enjoyment from the<lb/>  
world without only heightened their impatience at the<lb/>  
imprisonment to which they were doomed.</p>
            <pb n="222"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“Listen!” said Emily; “I think I hear a human<lb/>  
voice.”</p>
            <p>“There is certainly a distant call in the woods,” said<lb/>  
Le Maire, after a moment's silence. “Let us all<lb/>  
shout together for assistance.”</p>
            <p>They shouted accordingly, Le Maire exerting his<lb/>  
clear and powerful voice to the utmost, and the others<lb/>  
aiding him as well as they were able, with their feebler<lb/>  
and less practised organs. A shrill discordant cry <lb/>replied, apparently from the cliffs close to the cave.</p>
            <p>“A parrokeet,” exclaimed Le Maire. “The noisy<lb/>  
pest! I wish the painted rascal were within reach<lb/>  
of my rifle. You see, Father Ambrose, we are forgotten<lb/>  
by mankind; and the very birds of the wilderness mock<lb/>  
our cries for assistance.”</p>
            <p>“You have a quick fancy, my son,” answered the<lb/>  
priest; “but it is yet quite too soon to give over. It is<lb/>  
now the very hour when we may expect our <lb/>neighbours to be looking for us in these parts.”</p>
            <p>They continued therefore to remain by the opening;<lb/>  
and from time to time to raise that shout for assistance.<lb/>  
Hour after hour passed, and no answer was returned to<lb/>  
their cries, which indeed could have been but feebly<lb/>  
heard, if heard at all, at the foot of the precipice; hour<lb/>  
after hour passed, and no foot climbed the rocky stair<lb/>  
that led to their prison. The pangs of hunger in the<lb/>  
mean time began to assail them, and, more intolerable<lb/>  
than these, a feverish and tormenting thirst.</p>
            <p>“You have practised fasting,” said Le Maire to <lb/>Father Ambrose; “and so have I when I could get nothing<lb/>  
to eat. In my hunting excursions I have sometimes<lb/>  
gone without tasting food from morning till the night of<lb/>  
the next day. I found relief from an expedient which<lb/>  
I learned of the old hunters, but which I presume you<lb/>  
churchmen are not acquainted with. Here it is.”</p>
            <p>Saying this, he passed the sash he wore once more<lb/>  
round his body, drawing it tightly, and securing it by a<lb/>
               <pb n="223"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
firm knot. Father Ambrose declined adopting, for the<lb/>  
present, a similar expedient, alleging that as yet he had<lb/>  
suffered little inconvenience from want of food, except<lb/>  
a considerable degree of thirst; but Emily, already<lb/>  
weak from fasting, allowed her slender waist to be<lb/>  
wrapped tightly in the folds of a silk shawl which she<lb/>  
had brought with her. The importunities of hunger<lb/>  
were thus rendered less painful, and a new tension was<lb/>  
given to the enervated frame; but the burning thirst<lb/>  
was not at all allayed. The cave was then explored<lb/>  
for water; every corner was examined, and holes were<lb/>  
dug in the soil which in some places covered the rocky<lb/>  
floor, but in vain. Le Maire again ventured into the<lb/>  
long narrow passage which he had followed to its <lb/>termination the day previous, in the hope of now discovering<lb/>  
some concealed spring, or some place where the much<lb/>  
desired element fell in drops from the roof, but he <lb/>returned fatigued and unsuccessful. As he came forth<lb/>  
into the larger apartment a light fluttering sound, as of<lb/>  
the waving of a thin garment, attracted the attention of<lb/>  
the party. On listening attentively it appeared to be<lb/>  
within the cavern; but what most excited their <lb/>surprise was, that it passed suddenly and mysteriously<lb/>  
from place to place, while the agent continued invisible,<lb/>  
in spite of all their endeavours to discover it. Sometimes<lb/>  
it was heard on the one side, sometimes on the other,<lb/>  
now from the roof, and now from the floor, near, and at<lb/>  
a distance. At length it passed directly over their heads.</p>
            <p>“It is precisely the sound of a light robe agitated by<lb/>  
the wind, or by a swift motion of the person wearing<lb/>  
it,” said Emily.</p>
            <p>“It is no sound of this earth, I will depose in a court<lb/>  
of justice,” said Le Maire, who was naturally of a<lb/>  
superstitious turn; “or we should see the thing that<lb/>  
makes it.”</p>
            <p>“All we can say at present,” answered the priest,<lb/>  
“is, that we cannot discover the cause; but it does<lb/>
               <pb n="224"/>  
not therefore follow that it is any thing supernatural.<lb/>  
What is perceived by one of our senses only does not<lb/>  
necessarily belong to the other world. I have no doubt<lb/>  
however, that we shall discover the cause before we<lb/>  
leave the cavern.”</p>
            <p>“Nor I either,” rejoined Le Maire, with a look and<lb/>  
tone which showed the awe that had mastered him;<lb/>  
“I am satisfied of the cause already. It is a warning<lb/>  
of approaching death. We must perish in this cavern.”</p>
            <p>Emily, much as she was accustomed to rely on the<lb/>  
opinions of the priest, felt in spite of herself the infection<lb/>  
of that feeling of superstitious terror which had seized<lb/>  
upon her uncle, and her heart had begun to beat thick,<lb/>  
when a weak chirp was heard.</p>
            <p>“The mystery is resolved,” exclaimed Father <lb/>Ambrose, “and your ghost, my good friend, is only<lb/>  
a harmless fellow-prisoner, a poor bird, which the<lb/>  
storm doubtless drove into the cave, and which has<lb/>  
been confined here ever since.” As he spoke, Emily,<lb/>  
who had looked to the quarter whence the sound <lb/>proceeded, pointed out the bird sitting on a projection of<lb/>  
rock at no great distance.</p>
            <p>“A godsend!” cried Le Maire; “the bird is ours,<lb/>  
though his little carcass will hardly furnish a mouthful<lb/>  
for each of us.” Saying this, he took up his rifle,<lb/>  
which stood leaning against the wall of the cavern, and<lb/>  
raised the piece to his eye. Another instant and the<lb/>  
bird would have fallen, but Emily laid her hand on his<lb/>  
arm.</p>
            <p>“Cannot we take him alive,” asked she; “and<lb/>  
make him the agent of our deliverance?”</p>
            <p>“How will you do that?” said Le Maire, without<lb/>  
lowering his rifle.</p>
            <p>“Send him out at the opening yonder with a letter<lb/>  
tied to his wing to inform our friends of our situation.<lb/>  
It will at least increase the chances of our escape.”</p>
            <p>“It is well thought of,” answered Le Maire; “and<lb/>
               <pb n="225"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
now, Emily, you shall see how an experienced hunter<lb/>  
takes a bird without harming a single feather of his<lb/>  
wings.”</p>
            <p>Saying this, he went to the mouth of the cave, and<lb/>  
began to turn up, with a splinter of wood, the fresh<lb/>  
earth. After considerable examination he drew forth a<lb/>  
beetle, and producing from his hunting-bag a quantity<lb/>  
of packthread, he tied the insect to one end of it, and<lb/>  
having placed it on the point of a crag, retired to a little<lb/>  
distance with the other end of the packthread in his hand.<lb/>  
By frequently changing his place, he caused the bird to<lb/>  
approach the spot where he had laid the insect. It was<lb/>  
a tedious process; but when at length the bird <lb/>perceived his prey, he flew to it and snapped it up in an<lb/>  
instant, with the eagerness of famine. By a similar<lb/>  
piece of management he contrived to get the thread<lb/>  
wound several times about one of the legs of the little<lb/>  
creature; and when this was effected, he suddenly<lb/>  
drew it in, bringing him fluttering and struggling to<lb/>  
his hand. It proved to be of the species commonly<lb/>  
called the cedar bird.</p>
            <p>“Ah, Father Ambrose,” cried Le Maire, whose<lb/>  
vivacity returned with whatever revived his hopes, “we<lb/>  
have caught you a brother ecclesiastic, a <hi rend="italics">recollet,</hi> as we<lb/>  
call him from the gray hood he wears. No wonder we<lb/>  
did not see him before, for his plumage is exactly of<lb/>  
the colour of the rocks. But he is the very bird for a<lb/>  
letter; look at the sealing-wax he carries on his wings.”<lb/>  
As he spoke he displayed the glossy brown pinions,<lb/>  
the larger feathers of which were ornamented at their<lb/>  
tops with little appendages of a vermilion colour, like<lb/>  
drops of delicate red sealing-wax.</p>
            <p>“And now let us think,” continued he, “of writing the<lb/>  
letter which this dapper little monk is to carry for us.”<lb/>  
A piece of charcoal was brought from the skeleton's<lb/>  
chamber, and Le Maire having produced some paper<lb/>  
from his hunting-bag, the priest wrote upon it a few<lb/>
               <pb n="226"/>  
lines, giving a brief account of their situation. The<lb/>  
letter, being folded, and properly addressed, was next<lb/>  
perforated with holes, through which a string was <lb/>inserted, and tied under the wing of the bird. Emily<lb/>  
then carried him to the opening, through which he<lb/>  
darted forth in apparent joy at regaining his liberty.<lb/>  
“Would that we could pass out,” said she, with a sigh,<lb/>  
“as easily as the little creature which we have just<lb/>  
set free. But the <hi rend="italics">recollet</hi> is a lover of gardens, and he<lb/>  
will soon be found seeking his food in those of the<lb/>  
village.”</p>
            <p>The hopes to which this little expedient gave birth<lb/>  
in the bosoms of all contributed somewhat to cheer<lb/>  
the gloom of their confinement. But night came at<lb/>  
length, to close that long and weary day; a night still<lb/>  
more long and weary. The light which came in at<lb/>  
the aperture began to wane, and Emily watched it as it<lb/>  
faded, with a sickness of the heart which grew almost<lb/>  
to agony, when finally it ceased to shine altogether.<lb/>  
She had continued during the day to cherish the dream<lb/>  
of deliverance by the sagacity and exertions of her<lb/>  
lover; and had scarcely allowed herself to <lb/>contemplate the possibility of remaining in the cavern another<lb/>  
night. It was therefore in unspeakable bitterness of<lb/>  
spirit that she accompanied the priest and Le Maire to<lb/>  
the skeleton's chamber, where they collected the brands<lb/>  
which remained of the fire of the preceding night, and<lb/>  
kindled them into a dull and meager flame. That <lb/>evening was a silent one—the day had been passed in <lb/>various speculations on the probability of their release, in<lb/>  
searching the cave for water, and in shouting at the<lb/>  
entrance for assistance. But the hour of darkness,—<lb/>  
the hour which carried their neighbours of the village to<lb/>  
their quiet and easy beds, in their homes, overflowing<lb/>  
with abundance, filled with the sweet air of heaven,<lb/>  
and watched by its kindly constellations—that hour<lb/>  
brought to the unhappy prisoners of the rock a peculiar<lb/>
               <pb n="227"/>  
sense of desolation and fear, for it was a token that<lb/>  
they were, for the time at least, forgotten; that those<lb/>  
whom they knew and loved slumbered, and thought<lb/>  
not of them. They laid themselves down upon their<lb/>  
beds of leaves, but the horrible thirst, which consumed<lb/>  
them like an inward fire, grew fiercer with the <lb/>endeavour to court repose; and the blood that crept slowly<lb/>  
through their veins seemed to have become a current<lb/>  
of liquid flame. Sleep came not to their eyes, or came<lb/>  
attended with dreams of running waters, which they<lb/>  
were not permitted to taste; of tempests and <lb/>earthquakes, and breathless confinement among the clods<lb/>  
of earth and various shapes of strange peril, while<lb/>  
their friends seemed to stand aloof, and to look coldly<lb/>  
and unconcernedly on, without showing even a desire<lb/>  
to render them assistance.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi> the third day the cavern presented a more gloomy<lb/>  
spectacle than it had done at any time since the fall of<lb/>  
the rock took place. It was now about eleven o'clock in<lb/>  
the morning, and the shrill singing of the wind about<lb/>  
the cliffs, and through the crevice, which now admitted<lb/>  
a dimmer light than on the day previous, announced<lb/>  
the approach of a storm from the south. The hope of<lb/>  
relief from without was growing fainter and fainter as<lb/>  
the time passed on; and the sufferings of the prisoners<lb/>  
became more poignant. The approach of the storm,<lb/>  
too, could only be regarded as an additional misfortune,<lb/>  
since it would probably prevent or obstruct for that day<lb/>  
the search which was making for them. They were<lb/>  
all three in the outer and larger apartment of the cave.<lb/>  
Emily was at a considerable distance from the entrance<lb/>  
reclining on a kind of seat formed of large loose stones,<lb/>  
and overspread with a covering of withered leaves.<lb/>  
There was enough of light to show that she was <lb/>exceedingly pale; that her eyes were closed, and that<lb/>
               <pb n="229"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
the breath came thick and pantingly through her parted<lb/>  
lips, which alone of all her features retained the colour<lb/>  
of life. Faint with watching, with want of sustenance,<lb/>  
and with anxiety, she had lain herself down on this<lb/>  
rude couch, which the care of her companions had <lb/>provided for her, and had sunk into a temporary slumber.<lb/>  
The priest stood close to the mouth of the cave leaning<lb/>  
against the wall, with his arms folded, himself scarcely<lb/>  
changed in appearance, except that his cheek seemed<lb/>  
somewhat more emaciated, and his eyes were lighted<lb/>  
up with a kind of solemn and preternatural brightness.<lb/>  
Le Maire, with a spot of fiery red on each cheek,—<lb/>  
his hair staring wildly in every direction, and his eyes<lb/>  
bloodshot, was pacing the cavern floor to and fro, <lb/>carrying his rifle, occasionally stopping to examine the <lb/>priming, or to peck the flint; and sometimes standing still<lb/>  
for a moment, as if lost in thought. At length he <lb/>approached the priest, and said to him, in a hollow voice,</p>
            <p>“Have you never heard of seamen on a wreck, <lb/>destitute of provisions, casting lots to see which of their<lb/>  
number should die, that the rest might live?”</p>
            <p>“I have so.”</p>
            <p>“Were they right in so doing?”</p>
            <p>“I cannot say that they were not. It is a horrid<lb/>  
alternative in which they were placed. It might be<lb/>  
lawful—it might be expedient, that one should perish<lb/>  
for the salvation of the rest.”</p>
            <p>“Have you never seen an insect or an animal <lb/>writhing with torture, and have you not shortened its <lb/>sufferings by putting an end to its life?”</p>
            <p>“I have—but what mean these questions?”</p>
            <p>“I will tell you. Here is my rifle.” As he spoke,<lb/>  
Le Maire placed the piece in the hands of Father <lb/>Ambrose, who took it mechanically. “I ask you to do for<lb/>  
me what you would do for the meanest worm. You<lb/>  
understand me?”</p>
            <p>“Are you mad?” demanded the priest, regarding<lb/>
               <pb n="230"/>  
him with a look in which the expression of unaffected<lb/>  
astonishment was mingled with that of solemn reproof.</p>
            <p>“Mad! indeed I am mad, if you will have it so—<lb/>  
you will feel less scruple at putting an end to the <lb/>existence of a madman. I cannot linger in this horrid<lb/>  
place, neglected and forgotten by those who should<lb/>  
have come to deliver me, suffering the slow approaches<lb/>  
of death—the pain—the fire in the veins—and, worst<lb/>  
of all, this fire in the brain,” said Le Maire, striking his<lb/>  
forehead. “They think,—if they think of me at all,—<lb/>  
that I am dying by slow tortures; I will disappoint<lb/>  
them. Listen, father,” continued he; “would it not<lb/>  
be better for you and Emily that I were dead?—is<lb/>  
there no way?—look at my veins, they are full yet,<lb/>  
and the muscles have not shrunk away from my limbs;<lb/>  
would you not both live the longer, if I were to die?”</p>
            <p>The priest recoiled at the horrid idea presented to<lb/>  
his mind. “We are not cannibals,” said he, “thanks<lb/>  
be to Divine Providence.” An instant's reflection,<lb/>  
however, convinced Father Ambrose that the style of<lb/>  
rebuke which he had adopted was not proper for the<lb/>  
occasion. The unwonted fierceness and wildness of<lb/>  
Le Maire's manner, and the strange proposal he had<lb/>  
made, denoted that alienation of mind which is no <lb/>uncommon effect of long abstinence from food. He<lb/>  
thought it better, therefore, to attempt by mild and <lb/>soothing language to divert him from his horrid design.</p>
            <p>“My good friend,” said he, “you forget what<lb/>  
grounds of hope yet remain to us; indeed, the <lb/>probability of our escape is scarcely less to-day than it was<lb/>  
yesterday. The letter sent out of the cave may be<lb/>  
found, and if so, it will most certainly effect our <lb/>deliverance; or the fall of the rock may be discovered by<lb/>  
some one passing this way, and he may understand<lb/>  
that it is possible we are confined here. While our<lb/>  
existence is prolonged there is no occasion for despair.<lb/>  
You should endeavour, my son, to compose yourself,<lb/>
               <pb n="231"/>  
and to rely on the goodness of that Power who has never<lb/>  
forsaken you.”</p>
            <p>“Compose myself!” answered Le Maire, who had<lb/>  
listened impatiently to this exhortation; “compose<lb/>  
myself! Do you not know that there are those here who<lb/>  
will not suffer me to be tranquil for a moment? Last<lb/>  
night I was twice awakened, just as I had fallen asleep,<lb/>  
by a voice pronouncing my name, as audibly as I heard<lb/>  
your own just now; and the second time, I looked to<lb/>  
where the skeleton lies, and the foul thing had <lb/>half-raised itself from the rock, and was beckoning me to<lb/>  
come and place myself by its side. Can you wonder<lb/>  
if I slept no more after that?”</p>
            <p>“My son, these are but the dreams of a fever.”</p>
            <p>“And then, whenever I go by myself, I hear low<lb/>  
voices and titterings of laughter from the recesses of<lb/>  
the rocks. They mock me, that I, a free hunter, a<lb/>  
denizen of the woods and prairies, a man whose <lb/>liberty was never restrained for a moment, should be <lb/>entrapped in this manner, and made to die like a buffalo<lb/>  
in a pit, or like a criminal in the dungeons of the old<lb/>  
world,—that I should consume with thirst in a land<lb/>  
bright with innumerable rivers and springs,—that I<lb/>  
should wither away with famine, while the woods are<lb/>  
full of game and the prairies covered with buffaloes.<lb/>  
I could face famine if I had my liberty. I could meet<lb/>  
death without shrinking in the sight of the sun and the<lb/>  
earth, and in the fresh open air. I should strive to reach<lb/>  
some habitation of my fellow-creatures; I should be<lb/>  
sustained by hope; I should travel on till I sank down<lb/>  
with weakness and fatigue, and died on the spot. But<lb/>  
famine made more frightful by imprisonment and <lb/>inactivity. and these dreams, as you call them, that dog me<lb/>  
asleep and awake, they are more than I can bear.—<lb/>  
Hark!” he exclaimed, after a short pause, and <lb/>throwing quick and wild glances around him; “do you hear<lb/>
               <pb n="232"/>  
them yonder—do you hear how they mock me!—you<lb/>  
will not, then, do what I ask?—give me the rifle.”</p>
            <p>“No,” said the priest, who instantly comprehended<lb/>  
his purpose: “I must keep the piece till you are more<lb/>  
composed.”</p>
            <p>Le Maire seemed not to hear the answer, but laying<lb/>  
his grasp on the rifle, was about to pluck it from the<lb/>  
old man's hands. Father Ambrose saw that the <lb/>attempt to retain possession of it against his superior<lb/>  
strength, would be vain; he therefore slipped down his<lb/>  
right hand to the lock, and cocking it, touched the <lb/>trigger, and discharged it in an instant. The report awoke<lb/>  
Emily, who came trembling and breathless to the spot.</p>
            <p>“What is the matter?” she asked.</p>
            <p>“There is no harm done, my child,” answered the<lb/>  
priest, assuming an aspect of the most perfect <lb/>composure. “I discharged the rifle, but it was not aimed at<lb/>  
any thing, and I beg pardon for interrupting your repose<lb/>  
at a time when you so much need it. Suffer me to<lb/>  
conduct you back to the place you have left. Le<lb/>  
Maire, will you assist?”</p>
            <p>Supported by Le Maire on one side, and by the priest<lb/>  
on the other, Emily, scarcely able to walk from <lb/>weakness, wasled back to her place of repose. Returning with<lb/>  
Le Maire, Father Ambrose entreated him to consider<lb/>  
how much his niece stood in need of his assistance and<lb/>  
protection. He bade him recollect that his mad haste to<lb/>  
quit the world before called by his Maker would leave<lb/>  
her, should she ever be released from the cavern, alone<lb/>  
and defenceless, or at least with only an old man for<lb/>  
her friend, who was himself hourly expecting the <lb/>summons of death. He exhorted him to reflect how much,<lb/>  
even now, in her present condition of weakness and<lb/>  
peril, she stood in need of his aid, and conjured him not<lb/>  
to be guilty of a pusillanimous and cowardly desertion<lb/>  
of one so lovely, so innocent, and so dependent upon<lb/>  
him.</p>
            <pb n="233"/>
            <p/>
            <p>Le Maire felt the force of this appeal. A look of<lb/>  
human pity passed across the wild expression of his<lb/>  
countenance. He put the rifle into the hands of Father<lb/>  
Ambrose. “You are right,” said he; “I am a fool,<lb/>  
and I have been, I suspect, very near becoming a <lb/>madman. You will keep this until you are entirely willing<lb/>  
to trust me with it. I will endeavour to combat these<lb/>  
fancies a little longer.”</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the mean time the light from the aperture grew<lb/>  
dimmer and dimmer, and the eyes of the prisoners,<lb/>  
though accustomed to the twilight of the cavern, <lb/>became at length unable to distinguish objects at a few<lb/>  
paces from the entrance. The priest and Le Maire<lb/>  
had placed themselves by the couch of Emily, but<lb/>  
rather, as it seemed, from that instinct of our race which<lb/>  
leads us to seek each other's presence, than for any<lb/>  
purpose of conversation, for each of the party preserved<lb/>  
a gloomy silence. The topics of speculation on their<lb/>  
condition had been discussed to weariness, and no<lb/>  
others had now any interest for their minds. It was no<lb/>  
unwelcome interruption to that melancholy silence,<lb/>  
when they heard the sound of a mighty rain pouring<lb/>  
down upon the leafy summits of the woods, and <lb/>beating against the naked walls and shelves of the precipice.<lb/>  
The roar grew more and more distinct, and at length it<lb/>
               <pb n="234"/>  
seemed that they could distinguish a sort of <lb/>shuddering of the earth above them, as if a mighty host was<lb/>  
marching heavily over it. The sense of suffering was<lb/>  
for a moment suspended in a feeling of awe and <lb/>curiosity.</p>
            <p>“That, likewise, is the rain,” said Father Ambrose,<lb/>  
after listening for a moment. “The clouds must pour<lb/>  
down a perfect cataract, when the weight of its fall is<lb/>  
thus felt in the heart of the rock.”</p>
            <p>“Do you hear that noise of running water?” asked<lb/>  
Emily, whose quick ear had distinguished the rush of<lb/>  
the stream formed by the collected rains over the<lb/>  
rocks without at the mouth of the cave.</p>
            <p>“Would that its channel were through this cavern,”<lb/>  
exclaimed Le Maire, starting up. “Ah! here we have<lb/>  
it—we have it!—listen to the dropping of water from<lb/>  
the roof near the entrance. And here at the aperture!”<lb/>  
He sprang thither in an instant. A little stream <lb/>detached from the main current, which descended over<lb/>  
rocks that closed the mouth of the cave, fell in a thread<lb/>  
of silver amid the faint light that streamed through<lb/>  
the opening; he knelt for a moment, received it <lb/>between his burning lips, and then hastily returning, bore<lb/>  
Emily to the spot. She held out her hollowed palm,<lb/>  
white, thin, and semi-transparent, like a pearly shell,<lb/>  
used for dipping up the waters from one of those sweet<lb/>  
fountains that rise by the very edge of the sea—<lb/>  
and as fast as it filled with the cool, bright element,<lb/>  
imbibed it with an eagerness and delight inexpressible.<lb/>  
The priest followed her example; Le Maire also drank<lb/>  
from the little stream as it fell, bathed in it his feverish<lb/>  
brow, and suffered it to fall upon his sinewy neck.</p>
            <p>“It has given me a new hold on life,” said Le Maire,<lb/>  
his chest distending with several full and long <lb/>breathings. “It has not only quenched that hellish thirst,<lb/>  
but it has made my head less light, and my heart lighter.<lb/>  
I will never speak ill of this element again—the choicest<lb/>
               <pb n="235"/>  
grapes of France never distilled any thing so delicious,<lb/>  
so grateful, so life-giving. Take notice, Father <lb/>Ambrose, I retract all I have ever said against water and<lb/>  
water-drinkers. I am a sincere penitent, and shall <lb/>demand absolution.”</p>
            <p>Father Ambrose had begun gently to reprove Le<lb/>  
Maire for his unseasonable levity, when Emily cried<lb/>  
out—“The rock moves!—the rock moves! Come<lb/>  
back—come further into the cavern!” Looking up to<lb/>  
the vast mass that closed the entrance, he saw plainly<lb/>  
that it was in motion, and he had just time to draw Le<lb/>  
Maire from the spot where he had stooped down to<lb/>  
take another draught of the stream, when a large<lb/>  
block, which had been wedged in overhead, gave way,<lb/>  
and fell in the very place where he left the prints<lb/>  
of his feet. Had he remained there another instant, it<lb/>  
must have crushed him to atoms. The prisoners, <lb/>retreating within the cavern far enough to avoid the <lb/>danger, but not too far for observation, stood watching the<lb/>  
event with mingled apprehension and hope. The floor<lb/>  
of the cave just at the edge, on which rested the fallen<lb/>  
rock, yawned at the fissures, where the earth with which<lb/>  
they were filled had become saturated and swelled<lb/>  
with water, and unable any longer to support the <lb/>immense weight, settled away, at first slowly, under it,<lb/>  
and finally, along with its incumbent load, fell <lb/>suddenly and with a tremendous crash, to the base of the<lb/>  
precipice, letting the light of day and the air of heaven<lb/>  
into the cavern. The thunder of that disruption was <lb/>succeeded by the fall of a few large fragments of rock on<lb/>  
the right and left, after which the priest and his <lb/>companions heard only the fall of the rain and the heavy<lb/>  
sighing of the wind in the forest.</p>
            <p>Father Ambrose and Emily knelt involuntarily in<lb/>  
thanksgiving at their unexpected deliverance. Le<lb/>  
Maire, although unused to the devotional mood, <lb/>observing their attitude, had bent his knee to imitate it, when<lb/>
               <pb n="236"/>  
a glance at the outer world now laid open to his sight,<lb/>  
made him start again to his feet with an exclamation of<lb/>  
delight. The other two arose, also, and turned to the<lb/>  
broad opening which now looked out from the cave over<lb/>  
the fores. On one side of this opening rushed the<lb/>  
torrent whose friendly waters had undermined the rock<lb/>  
at the entrance, and now dashed themselves against its<lb/>  
shivered fragments below. It is not for me to attempt<lb/>  
to describe how beautiful appeared to their eyes that<lb/>  
world which they feared never again to see, or how<lb/>  
grateful to their senses was that fresh and fragrant air<lb/>  
of the forests which they thought never to breathe again.<lb/>  
The light, although the sky was thick with clouds and<lb/>  
rain, was almost too intense for their vision, and they<lb/>  
shaded their brows with their hands as they looked<lb/>  
forth upon that scene of woods and meadows and waters,<lb/>  
fairer to their view than it had ever appeared in the<lb/>  
most glorious sunshine.</p>
            <p>“That world is ours again,” said Le Maire, with a<lb/>  
tone of exultation. “We are released at last, and now<lb/>  
let us see in what manner we can descend.”</p>
            <p>As he spoke, he approached the verge of the rock from<lb/>  
which the severed mass had lately fallen, and saw to his<lb/>  
dismay that the terrace which had served as a path to the<lb/>  
cavern, was carried away for a considerable distance to<lb/>  
the right and left of where they stood, leaving the face<lb/>  
of the precipice smooth and sheer from top to bottom.<lb/>  
No footing appeared, no projection by which the <lb/>boldest and the most agile could scale or descend it. Le<lb/>  
Maire threw himself sullenly on the ground.</p>
            <p>“We must pass another night in this dungeon,” said<lb/>  
he, “and perhaps starve to death after all. It is clear<lb/>  
enough that we shall have to remain here until <lb/>somebody comes to take us down, and the devil himself<lb/>  
would not be caught abroad in the woods in the midst of<lb/>  
such a storm as this.”</p>
            <p>The priest and Emily came up at this moment:—<lb/>
               <pb n="237"/>  
“This is a sad disappointment,” said the former, “but<lb/>  
we have this advantage, that we can now make <lb/>ourselves both seen and heard. Let us try the effect of<lb/>  
our voices. It is not impossible that there may be<lb/>  
some person within hearing.”</p>
            <p>Accordingly they shouted together, and though <lb/>nothing answered but the echo of the forest, yet there<lb/>  
was even in that reply of the inanimate creation <lb/>something cheering and hope-inspiring, to those who for<lb/>  
nearly three days had perceived that all their cries for<lb/>  
succour were smothered in the depths of the earth.<lb/>  
Again they raised their voices, and listened for an <lb/>answering shout,—a third time, and they were answered.<lb/>  
The halloo of a full-toned, manly voice arose from the<lb/>  
woods below.</p>
            <p>“Thank heaven, we are heard at last,” said Emily.</p>
            <p>“Let us see if the cry was in answer to ours,” said<lb/>  
the priest, and again they called, and again a shout was<lb/>  
returned from the woods. “We are heard—that is <lb/>certain,” continued he, “and the voice is nearer than at<lb/>  
first,—we shall be released.”</p>
            <p>At length the sound of quick footsteps on the <lb/>crackling boughs was heard in the forest, and a young man<lb/>  
of graceful proportions, dressed, like Le Maire, in a<lb/>  
hunting-cap and frock, emerged into the open space at<lb/>  
the foot of the precipice. As he saw the party standing<lb/>  
in the cavity of the rock, he clapped his hands with an<lb/>  
exclamation of surprise and delight. “Thank heaven,<lb/>  
they are discovered at last! Are you all safe—all<lb/>  
well?”</p>
            <p>“All safe,” answered Le Maire, “but hungry as<lb/>  
wolves, and in a confounded hurry to get out of this<lb/>  
horrid den.”</p>
            <p>The young man regarded the precipice attentively<lb/>  
for a moment, and then called out, “Have patience a<lb/>  
moment, and I will bring you the means of deliverance.”<lb/>  
He then disappeared in the forest.</p>
            <pb n="238"/>
            <p/>
            <p>Emily's waking dream was, in fact, not wholly <lb/>unfulfilled. That young man was Henry Danville; she<lb/>  
knew him by his air and figure as soon as he emerged<lb/>  
from the forest, and before she heard his voice. He had<lb/>  
been engaged, with many others belonging to the <lb/>settlement, in the pursuit of their lost curate and his <lb/>companions, from the morning after their absence, and <lb/>fortunately happened to be at no great distance when the<lb/>  
disruption of the rock took place. Struck with <lb/>astonishment at the tremendous concussion, he was hastening<lb/>  
to discover the cause, when he heard the shout to which<lb/>  
he answered.</p>
            <p>It was not long before voices and steps were again<lb/>  
heard in the wood, and a crowd of the good villagers<lb/>  
soon appeared advancing through the trees, one <lb/>bearing a basket of provisions, some dragging ladders, some<lb/>  
carrying ropes and other appliances for getting down<lb/>  
their friends from their perilous elevation. Several of<lb/>  
the ladders being spliced together, and secured by<lb/>  
strong cords, were made to reach from the broken rocks<lb/>  
below to the mouth of the cavern, and Henry ascended.</p>
            <p>My readers will have no difficulty in imagining the<lb/>  
conclusion. The emotions of the lovers at meeting<lb/>  
under such circumstances are of course not to be <lb/>described, and the dialogue that took place on that <lb/>occasion would not, I fear, bear to be repeated. The joy<lb/>  
expressed by the villagers at recovering their worthy<lb/>  
pastor brought tears into the good man's eyes; and<lb/>  
words are inadequate to do justice to the delight of Le<lb/>  
Maire at seeing his old companions and their basket of<lb/>  
provisions. My readers may also, if they please, <lb/>imagine another little incident, without which some of them<lb/>  
might think the narrative imperfect, namely, a certain<lb/>  
marriage ceremony, which actually took place before<lb/>  
the next Christmas, and at which the venerable Father<lb/>  
Ambrose officiated. Le Maire, when I last saw him,<lb/>  
was living with one of Emily's children, a hale old man<lb/>
               <pb n="239"/>  
of eighty, with a few gray hairs scattered among his<lb/>  
raven locks, full of stories of his youthful adventures,<lb/>  
among which he reckoned that of his imprisonment in<lb/>  
the cave as decidedly the best. He had, however, no<lb/>  
disposition to become the hero of another tale of the<lb/>  
kind, since he never ventured into another cave, or <lb/>under another rock, as long as he lived; and was wont<lb/>  
to accompany his narrative with a friendly admonition<lb/>  
to his youthful and inexperienced hearers, against<lb/>  
thoughtlessly indulging in so dangerous a practice.</p>
