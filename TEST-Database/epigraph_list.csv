“SHALL tongues be mute when deeds are wrought
Which well might shame extremest Hell?
Shall freemen lack th' indignant thought?
Shall Mercy's bosom cease to swell?
Shall Honour bleed?—shall Truth succumb?
Shall pen, and press, and soul be dumb?”—
Whittier.

The medley mass of pride and misery,
Of whips and charters, manacles and rights,
Of slaving blacks and democratic whites,

O'er creatures like himself, with souls from thee,
Yet dare to boast of perfect liberty”—

Round the white feet of laughing girls,
Whose sires have marched to Rome.
