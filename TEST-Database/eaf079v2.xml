               <hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is seldom that man is required to make an exertion<lb/>  
as desperate and appalling, in all its circumstances, as that<lb/>  
on which Harry Mulford was now bent. The night was<lb/>  
starlight, it was true, and it was possible to see objects<lb/>  
near by with tolerable distinctness; still, it was midnight,<lb/>  
and the gloom of that hour rested on the face of the sea,<lb/>  
lending its solemn mystery and obscurity to the other <lb/>trying features of the undertaking. Then there was the<lb/>  
uncertainty whether it was the boat at all, of which he<lb/>  
was in pursuit; and, if the boat, it might drift away from<lb/>  
him as fast as he could follow it. Nevertheless, the <lb/>perfect conviction that, without some early succour, the party<lb/>  
on the wreck, including Rose Budd, must inevitably perish,<lb/>  
stimulated him to proceed, and a passing feeling of doubt,<lb/>  
touching the prudence of his course, that came over the<lb/>  
young mate, when he was a few yards from the wreck,<lb/>  
vanished under a vivid renewal of this last conviction. On<lb/>  
he swam, therefore, riveting his eye on the “thoughtful<lb/>  
star” that guided his course, and keeping his mind as<lb/>  
tranquil as possible, in order that the exertions of his body<lb/>  
might be the easier.</p>
            <p>Mulford was an excellent swimmer. The want of food<lb/>  
was a serious obstacle to his making one of his best efforts,<lb/>
               <pb n="004"/>  
but, as yet, he was not very sensible of any great loss of<lb/>  
strength. Understanding fully the necessity of swimming<lb/>  
easily, if he would swim long, he did not throw out all his<lb/>  
energy at first, but made the movements of his limbs as<lb/>  
regular, continued, and skilful as possible. No strength<lb/>  
was thrown away, and his progress was in proportion to<lb/>  
the prudence of this manner of proceeding. For some<lb/>  
twenty minutes he held on his course, in this way, when<lb/>  
he began to experience a little of that weariness which is<lb/>  
apt to accompany an unremitted use of the same set of<lb/>  
muscles, in a monotonous and undeviating mode. <lb/>Accustomed to all the resources of his art, he turned on his back,<lb/>  
for the double purpose of relieving his arms for a minute,<lb/>  
and of getting a glimpse of the wreck, if possible, in <lb/>order to ascertain the distance he had overcome. Swim<lb/>  
long in this new manner, however, he could not with<lb/>  
prudence, as the star was necessary in order to keep the<lb/>  
direct line of his course. It may be well to explain to<lb/>  
some of our readers, that, though the surface of the<lb/>  
ocean may be like glass, as sometimes really happens, it is<lb/>  
never absolutely free from the long, undulating motion that<lb/>  
is known by the name of a “ground swell.” This swell,<lb/>  
on the present occasion, was not very heavy, but it was<lb/>  
sufficient to place our young mate, at moments, between<lb/>  
two dark mounds of water, that limited his view in either<lb/>  
direction to some eighty or a hundred yards; then it raised<lb/>  
him on the summit of a rounded wave, that enabled him<lb/>  
to see, far as his eye could reach under that obscure light.<lb/>  
Profiting by this advantage, Mulford now looked behind<lb/>  
him, in quest of the wreck, but uselessly. It might have<lb/>  
been in the trough, while he was thus on the summit of<lb/>  
the waves, or it might be that it floated so low as to be<lb/>  
totally lost to the view of one whose head was scarcely<lb/>  
above the surface of the water. For a single instant, the<lb/>  
young man felt a chill at his heart, as he fancied that the<lb/>  
wreck had already sunk; but it passed away when he <lb/>recalled the slow progress by which the air escaped, and he<lb/>  
saw the certainty that the catastrophe, however inevitable,<lb/>  
could not yet have really arrived. He waited for another<lb/>  
swell to lift him on its summit, when, by “treading water,”<lb/>  
he raised his head and shoulders fairly above the surface<lb/>
               <pb n="005"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
of the sea, and strained his eyes in another vain effort to<lb/>  
catch a glimpse of the wreck. He could not see it. In<lb/>  
point of fact, the mate had swum much further than he had<lb/>  
supposed, and was already so distant as to render any such<lb/>  
attempt hopeless. He was fully a third of a mile distant<lb/>  
from the point of his departure.</p>
            <p>Disappointed, and in a slight degree disheartened, <lb/>Mulford turned, and swam in the direction of the sinking star.<lb/>  
He now looked anxiously for the boat. It was time that it<lb/>  
came more plainly into view, and a new source of anxiety<lb/>  
beset him, as he could discover no signs of its vicinity.<lb/>  
Certain that he was on the course, after making a due <lb/>allowance for the direction of the wind, the stout-hearted<lb/>  
young man swam on. He next determined not to annoy<lb/>  
himself by fruitless searches, or vain regrets, but to swim<lb/>  
steadily for a certain time, a period long enough to carry<lb/>  
him a material distance, ere he again looked for the object<lb/>  
of his search.</p>
            <p>For twenty minutes longer did that courageous and <lb/>active youth struggle with the waste of waters, amid the <lb/>obscurity and solitude of midnight. He now believed himself<lb/>  
near a mile from the wreck, and the star which had so long<lb/>  
served him for a beacon was getting near to the horizon.<lb/>  
He took a new observation of another of the heavenly<lb/>  
bodies nigh it, to serve him in its stead when it should <lb/>disappear altogether, and then he raised himself in the water,<lb/>  
and looked about again for the boat. The search was in<lb/>  
vain. No boat was very near him, of a certainty, and the<lb/>  
dreadful apprehension began to possess his mind, of <lb/>perishing uselessly in that waste of gloomy waters. While thus<lb/>  
gazing about him, turning his eyes in every quarter, hoping<lb/>  
intently to catch some glimpse of the much-desired object<lb/>  
in the gloom, he saw two dark, pointed objects, that <lb/>resembled small stakes, in the water within twenty feet of him.<lb/>  
Mulford knew them at a glance, and a cold shudder passed<lb/>  
through his frame, as he recognised them. They were,<lb/>  
out of all question, the fins of an enormous shark; an <lb/>animal that could not measure less than eighteen or twenty<lb/>  
feet in length.</p>
            <p>It is scarcely necessary to say, that when our young mate<lb/>  
discovered the proximity of this dangerous animal, situated<lb/>
               <pb n="006"/>  
as he was, he gave himself up for lost. He possessed his<lb/>  
knife, however, and had heard of the manner in which even<lb/>  
sharks were overcome, and that too in their own element,<lb/>  
by the skilful and resolute. At first, he was resolved to<lb/>  
make one desperate effort for life, before he submitted to a<lb/>  
fate as horrible as that which now menaced him; but the<lb/>  
movements of his dangerous neighbour induced him to wait.<lb/>  
It did not approach any nearer, but continued swimming<lb/>  
back and fro, on the surface of the water, according to the<lb/>  
known habits of the fish, as if watching his own movements.<lb/>  
There being no time to be wasted, our young mate turned<lb/>  
on his face, and began again to swim in the direction of<lb/>  
the setting star, though nearly chilled by despair. For ten<lb/>  
minutes longer did he struggle on, beginning to feel <lb/>exhaustion, however, and always accompanied by those two<lb/>  
dark, sharp and gliding fins. There was no difficulty in<lb/>  
knowing the position of the animal, and Mulford's eyes<lb/>  
were oftener on those fins than on the beacon before him.<lb/>  
Strange as it may appear, he actually became accustomed<lb/>  
to the vicinity of this formidable creature, and soon felt his<lb/>  
presence a sort of relief against the dreadful solitude of his<lb/>  
situation. He had been told by seamen of instances, and<lb/>  
had once witnessed a case himself, in which a shark had<lb/>  
attended a swimming man for a long distance, either <lb/>forbearing to do him harm, from repletion, or influenced by<lb/>  
that awe which nature has instilled into all of the inferior,<lb/>  
for the highest animal of the creation. He began to think<lb/>  
that he was thus favoured, and really regarded the shark as<lb/>  
a friendly neighbour, rather than as a voracious foe. In<lb/>  
this manner did the two proceed, nearly another third of a<lb/>  
mile, the fins sometimes in sight ahead, gliding hither and<lb/>  
thither, and sometimes out of view behind the swimmer,<lb/>  
leaving him in dreadful doubts as to the movements of the<lb/>  
fish, when Mulford suddenly felt something hard hit his<lb/>  
foot. Believing it to be the shark, dipping for his prey, a<lb/>  
slight exclamation escaped him. At the next instant both<lb/>  
feet hit the unknown substance again, and he stood erect,<lb/>  
the water no higher than his waist! Quick, and <lb/>comprehending everything connected with the sea, the young man<lb/>  
at once understood that he was on a part of the reef where<lb/>  
the water was so shallow as to admit of his wading.</p>
            <pb n="007"/>
            <p/>
            <p>Mulford felt that he had been providentially rescued from<lb/>  
death. His strength had been about to fail him, when he<lb/>  
was thus led, unknown to himself, to a spot where his life<lb/>  
might yet be possibly prolonged for a few more hours, or<lb/>  
days. He had leisure to look about him, and to reflect on<lb/>  
what was next to be done. Almost unwittingly, he turned<lb/>  
in quest of his terrible companion, in whose voracious<lb/>  
mouth he had actually believed himself about to be <lb/>immolated, a few seconds before. There the two horn-like fins<lb/>  
still were, gliding about above the water, and indicating<lb/>  
the smallest movement of their formidable owner. The<lb/>  
mate observed that they went a short distance ahead of him,<lb/>  
describing nearly a semi-circle, and then returned, doing<lb/>  
the same thing in his rear, repeating the movements <lb/>incessantly, keeping always on his right. This convinced him<lb/>  
that shoaler water existed on his left hand, and he waded<lb/>  
in that direction, until he reached a small spot of naked<lb/>  
rock.</p>
            <p>For a time, at least, he was safe! The fragment of coral<lb/>  
on which the mate now stood, was irregular in shape, but<lb/>  
might have contained a hundred feet square in superficial<lb/>  
measurement, and was so little raised above the level of<lb/>  
the water as not to be visible, even by daylight, at the <lb/>distance of a hundred yards. Mulford found it was perfectly<lb/>  
dry, however, an important discovery to him, as by a close<lb/>  
calculation he had made of the tides, since quitting the Dry<lb/>  
Tortugas, he knew it must be near high water. Could he<lb/>  
have even this small portion of bare rock secure, it made<lb/>  
him, for the moment, rich as the most extensive landholder<lb/>  
living. A considerable quantity of sea-weed had lodged<lb/>  
on the rock, and, as most of this was also quite dry, it <lb/>convinced the young sailor that the place was usually bare.<lb/>  
But, though most of this sea-weed was dry, there were <lb/>portions of the more recent accessions there that still lay in,<lb/>  
or quite near to the water, which formed exceptions. In<lb/>  
handling these weeds, in order to ascertain the facts, <lb/>Mulford caught a small shell-fish, and finding it fresh and easy<lb/>  
to open, he swallowed it with the eagerness of a famishing<lb/>  
man. Never had food proved half so grateful to him as<lb/>  
that single swallow of a very palatable testaceous animal.<lb/>  
By feeling further, he found several others of the same<lb/>
               <pb n="008"/>  
family, and made quite as large a meal, as, under the <lb/>circumstances, was probably good for him. Then, grateful<lb/>  
for his escape, but overcome by fatigue, he hastily arranged<lb/>  
a bed of sea-weed, drew a portion of the plant over his body,<lb/>  
to keep him warm, and fell into a deep sleep that lasted for<lb/>  
hours.</p>
            <p>Mulford did not regain his consciousness until the rays<lb/>  
of the rising sun fell upon his eye-lids, and the genial<lb/>  
warmth of the great luminary shed its benign influence<lb/>  
over his frame. At first his mind was confused, and it <lb/>required a few seconds to bring a perfect recollection of the<lb/>  
past, and a true understanding of his real situation. They<lb/>  
came, however, and the young man moved to the highest<lb/>  
part of his little domain, and cast an anxious, hurried look<lb/>  
around in quest of the wreck. A knowledge of the course<lb/>  
in which he had swum, aided by the position of the sun,<lb/>  
told him on what part of the naked waste to look for the<lb/>  
object he sought. God had not yet forsaken them! There<lb/>  
was the wreck; or, it might be more exact to say, there<lb/>  
were those whom the remaining buoyancy of the wreck<lb/>  
still upheld from sinking into the depths of the gulf. In<lb/>  
point of fact, but a very little of the bottom of the vessel<lb/>  
actually remained above water, some two or three yards<lb/>  
square at most, and that little was what seamen term nearly<lb/>  
awash. Two or three hours must bury that small portion<lb/>  
of the still naked wood beneath the surface of the sea,<lb/>  
though sufficient buoyancy might possibly remain for the<lb/>  
entire day still to keep the living from death.</p>
            <p>There the wreck was, however, yet floating; and, though<lb/>  
not visible to Mulford, with a small portion of it above<lb/>  
water. He saw the four persons only; and what was more,<lb/>  
they saw him. This was evident by Jack Tier's waving<lb/>  
his hat like a man cheering. When Mulford returned this<lb/>  
signal, the shawl of Rose was tossed into the air, in a way<lb/>  
to leave no doubt that he was seen and known. The <lb/>explanation of this early recognition and discovery of the<lb/>  
young mate was very simple. Tier was not asleep when<lb/>  
Harry left the wreck, though, seeing the importance of the<lb/>  
step the other was taking, he had feigned to be so. When<lb/>  
Rose awoke, missed her lover, and was told what had <lb/>happened, her heart was kept from sinking by his encouraging<lb/>
               <pb n="009"/>  
tale and hopes. An hour of agony had succeeded, <lb/>nevertheless, when light returned and no Mulford was to be seen.<lb/>  
The despair that burst upon the heart of our heroine was<lb/>  
followed by the joy of discovering him on the rock.</p>
            <p>It is scarcely necessary to say how much the parties were<lb/>  
relieved on ascertaining their respective positions. Faint<lb/>  
as were the hopes of each of eventual delivery, the two or<lb/>  
three minutes that succeeded seemed to be minutes of <lb/>perfect happiness. After this rush of unlooked-for joy, <lb/>Mulford continued his intelligent examination of surrounding<lb/>  
objects.</p>
            <p>The wreck was fully half a mile from the rock of the<lb/>  
mate, but much nearer to the reef than it had been the<lb/>  
previous night. “Could it but ground on the rocks,”<lb/>  
thought the young man, “it would be a most blessed<lb/>  
event.” The thing was possible, though the first half hour<lb/>  
of his observations told him that its drift was in the <lb/>direction of the open passage so often named, rather than toward<lb/>  
the nearest rocks. Still, that drift brought Rose each<lb/>  
minute nearer and nearer to himself again. In looking<lb/>  
round, however, the young man saw the boat. It was a<lb/>  
quarter of a mile distant, with open water between them,<lb/>  
apparently grounded on a rock, for it was more within the<lb/>  
reef than he was himself. He must have passed it in the<lb/>  
dark, and the boat had been left to obey the wind and <lb/>currents, and to drift to the spot where it then lay.</p>
            <p>Mulford shouted aloud when he saw the boat, and at<lb/>  
once determined to swim in quest of it, as soon as he had<lb/>  
collected a little refreshment from among the sea-weed. On<lb/>  
taking a look at his rock by daylight, he saw that its size<lb/>  
was quadrupled to the eye by the falling of the tide, and<lb/>  
that water was lying in several of the cavities of its uneven<lb/>  
surface. At first he supposed this to be sea-water, left by<lb/>  
the flood; but, reflecting a moment, he remembered the<lb/>  
rain, and hoped it might be possible that one little cavity,<lb/>  
containing two or three gallons of the fluid, would turn out<lb/>  
to be fresh. Kneeling beside it, he applied his lips in <lb/>feverish haste, and drank the sweetest draught that had ever<lb/>  
passed his lips. Slaking his thirst, which had begun again<lb/>  
to be painfully severe, he arose with a heart overflowing<lb/>  
with gratitude—could he only get Rose to that narrow and<lb/>
               <pb n="010"/>  
barren rock, it would seem to be an earthly paradise. <lb/>Mulford next made his scanty, but, all things considered, <lb/>sufficient meal, drank moderately afterward, and then turned<lb/>  
his attention and energies toward the boat, which, though<lb/>  
now aground and fast, might soon float on the rising tide,<lb/>  
and drift once more beyond his reach. It was his first <lb/>intention to swim directly for his object; but, just when about<lb/>  
to enter the water, he saw with horror the fins of at least a<lb/>  
dozen sharks, which were prowling about in the deeper water<lb/>  
of the reef, and almost encircling his hold. To throw <lb/>himself in the midst of such enemies would be madness, and<lb/>  
he stopped to reflect, and again to look about him. For<lb/>  
the first time that morning, he took a survey of the entire<lb/>  
horizon, to see if anything were in sight; for, hitherto, his<lb/>  
thoughts had been too much occupied with Rose and her<lb/>  
companions, to remember anything else. To the <lb/>northward and westward he distinctly saw the upper sails of a<lb/>  
large ship, that was standing on a wind to the northward<lb/>  
and eastward. As there was no port to which a vessel of<lb/>  
that character would be likely to be bound in the quarter<lb/>  
of the Gulf to which such a course would lead, Mulford at<lb/>  
once inferred it was the sloop-of-war, which, after having<lb/>  
examined the islets, at the Dry Tortugas, and finding them<lb/>  
deserted, was beating up, either to go into Key West, or<lb/>  
to pass to the southward of the reef again, by the passage<lb/>  
through which she had come as lately as the previous day.<lb/>  
This was highly encouraging; and could he only get to the<lb/>  
boat, and remove the party from the wreck before it sunk,<lb/>  
there was now every prospect of a final escape.</p>
            <p>To the southward, also, the mate fancied he saw a sail.<lb/>  
It was probably a much smaller vessel than the ship in the<lb/>  
north-west, and at a greater distance. It might, however,<lb/>  
be the lofty sails of some large craft; standing along the<lb/>  
reef, going westward, bound to New Orleans, or to that<lb/>  
new and important port, Point Isabel: or it might be some<lb/>  
wrecker, or other craft, edging away into the passage. As<lb/>  
it was, it appeared only as a speck in the horizon; and was<lb/>  
too far off to offer much prospect of succour.</p>
            <p>Thus acquainted with the state of things around him,<lb/>  
Mulford gave his attention seriously to his duties. He was<lb/>  
chiefly afraid that the returning tide might lift the boat<lb/>
               <pb n="011"/>  
from the rock on which it had grounded, and that it would<lb/>  
float beyond his reach. Then there was the frightful and<lb/>  
ever-increasing peril of the wreck, and the dreadful fate<lb/>  
that so inevitably menaced those that it held, were not <lb/>relief prompt. This thought goaded him nearly to <lb/>desperation, and he felt at moments almost ready to plunge into<lb/>  
the midst of the sharks, and fight his way to his object.</p>
            <p>But reflection showed him a less hazardous way of <lb/>making an effort to reach the boat. The sharks' fins described<lb/>  
a semicircle only, as had been the case of his single <lb/>attendant during the night, and he thought that the shealness of<lb/>  
the water prevented their going further than they did, in a<lb/>  
south-easterly direction, which was that of the boat. He<lb/>  
well knew that a shark required sufficient water to sink<lb/>  
beneath its prey, ere it made its swoop, and that it <lb/>uniformly turned on its back, and struck upward whenever it<lb/>  
gave one of its voracious bites. This was owing to the<lb/>  
greater length of its upper than of its lower jaw, and <lb/>Mulford had heard it was a physical necessity of its formation.<lb/>  
Right or wrong, he determined to act on this theory, and<lb/>  
began at once to wade along the part of the reef that his<lb/>  
enemies seemed unwilling to approach.</p>
            <p>Had our young mate a weapon of any sort larger than<lb/>  
his knife, he would have felt greater confidence in his <lb/>success. As it was, however, he drew that knife, and was<lb/>  
prepared to sell his life dearly should a foe assail him. No<lb/>  
sooner was his step heard in the water, than the whole<lb/>  
group of sharks were set in violent motion, glancing past,<lb/>  
and frequently quite near him, as if aware their intended<lb/>  
prey was about to escape. Had the water deepened much,<lb/>  
Harry would have returned at once, for a conflict with such<lb/>  
numbers would have been hopeless; but it did not; on the<lb/>  
contrary, it shoaled again, after a very short distance, at<lb/>  
which it had been waist-deep; and Mulford found himself<lb/>  
wading over a long, broad surface of rock, and that directly<lb/>  
toward the boat, through water that seldom rose above his<lb/>  
knees, and which, occasionally, scarce covered his feet.<lb/>  
There was no absolutely naked rock near him, but there<lb/>  
seemed to be acres of that which might be almost said to<lb/>  
be awash. Amid the greedy throng that endeavoured to<lb/>  
accompany him, the mate even fancied he recognised the<lb/>
               <pb n="012"/>  
enormous fins of his old companion, who sailed to and fro<lb/>  
in the crowd in a stately manner, as if merely a curious<lb/>  
looker-on of his own movements. It was the smaller, and<lb/>  
probably the younger sharks, that betrayed the greatest<lb/>  
hardihood and voracity. One or two of these made fierce<lb/>  
swoops toward Harry, as if bent on having him at every<lb/>  
hazard; but they invariably glided off when they found<lb/>  
their customary mode of attack resisted by the shoalness<lb/>  
of the water.</p>
            <p>Our young mate got ahead but slowly, being obliged to<lb/>  
pay a cautious attention to the movements of his escort.<lb/>  
Sometimes he was compelled to wade up to his arms in<lb/>  
order to cross narrow places, that he might get on portions<lb/>  
of the rock that were nearly bare; and once he was <lb/>actually compelled to swim eight or ten yards. Nevertheless,<lb/>  
he did get on, and after an hour of this sort of work, he<lb/>  
found himself within a hundred yards of the boat, which<lb/>  
lay grounded near a low piece of naked rock, but separated<lb/>  
from it by a channel of deep water, into which all the<lb/>  
sharks rushed in a body, as if expressly to cut off his <lb/>escape. Mulford now paused to take breath, and to consider<lb/>  
what ought to be done. On the spot where he stood he<lb/>  
was quite safe, though ancle-deep in the sea, the shallow<lb/>  
water extending to a considerable distance on all sides of<lb/>  
him, with the single exception of the channel in his front.<lb/>  
He stood on the very verge of that channel, and could see<lb/>  
in the pellucid element before him, that it was deep enough<lb/>  
to float a vessel of some size.</p>
            <p>To venture into the midst of twenty sharks required<lb/>  
desperation, and Harry was not yet reduced to that. He<lb/>  
had been so busy in making his way to the point where he<lb/>  
stood as to have no leisure to look for the wreck; but he<lb/>  
now turned his eyes in quest of that all-interesting object.<lb/>  
He saw the shawl fluttering in the breeze, and that was all<lb/>  
he could see. Tier had contrived to keep it flying as a<lb/>  
signal where he was to be found, but the hull of the schooner<lb/>  
had sunk so low in the water that they who were seated<lb/>  
on its keel were not visible even at the short distance which<lb/>  
now separated them from Mulford. Encouraged by this<lb/>  
signal, and animated by the revived hope of still saving his<lb/>  
companions, Harry turned toward the channel, half inclined<lb/>
               <pb n="013"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
to face every danger rather than to wait any longer. At<lb/>  
that moment the fins were all gliding along the channel<lb/>  
from him, and in the same direction. Some object drew<lb/>  
the sharks away in a body, and the young mate let himself<lb/>  
easily into the water, and swam as noiselessly as he could<lb/>  
toward the boat.</p>
            <p>It was a fearful trial, but Mulford felt that everything<lb/>  
depended on his success. Stimulated by his motive, and<lb/>  
strengthened by the food and water taken an hour before,<lb/>  
never had he shown so much skill and power in the water.<lb/>  
In an incredibly short period he was half-way across the<lb/>  
channel, still swimming strong and unharmed. A few<lb/>  
strokes more sent him so near the boat that hope took full<lb/>  
possession of his soul, and he shouted in exultation. That<lb/>  
indiscreet but natural cry, uttered so near the surface of<lb/>  
the sea, turned every shark upon him, as the pack springs<lb/>  
at the fox in view. Mulford was conscious of the folly of<lb/>  
his cry the instant it escaped him, and involuntarily he<lb/>  
turned his head to note the effect on his enemies. Every<lb/>  
fin was gliding toward him—a dark array of swift and <lb/>furious foes. Ten thousand bayonets, levelled in their line,<lb/>  
could not have been one-half as terrible, and the efforts of<lb/>  
the young man became nearly frantic. But strong as he<lb/>  
was, and ready in the element, what is the movement of a<lb/>  
man in the water compared to that of a vigorous and<lb/>  
voracious fish? Mulford could see those fins coming on like<lb/>  
a tempest, and he had just given up all hope, and was <lb/>feeling his flesh creep with terror, when his foot hit the rock.<lb/>  
Giving himself an onward plunge, he threw his body<lb/>  
upward toward the boat, and into so much shoaler water,<lb/>  
at least a dozen feet by that single effort. Recovering his<lb/>  
legs as soon as possible, he turned to look behind him.<lb/>  
The water seemed alive with fins, each pair gliding back<lb/>  
and forth, as the bull-dog bounds in front of the ox's <lb/>muzzle. Just then a light-coloured object glanced past the<lb/>  
young man, so near as almost to touch him. It was a<lb/>  
shark that had actually turned on its back to seize its prey,<lb/>  
and was only prevented from succeeding by being driven<lb/>  
from the line of its course by hitting the slimy rock, over<lb/>  
which it was compelled to make its plunge. The <lb/>momentum with which it came on, added to the inclination of the<lb/>
               <pb n="014"/>  
rock, forced the head and half of the body of this terrible<lb/>  
assailant into the air, giving the intended victim an <lb/>opportunity of seeing from what a fate he had escaped. Mulford<lb/>  
avoided this fish without much trouble, however, and the<lb/>  
next instant he threw himself into the boat, on the bottom<lb/>  
of which he lay panting with the violence of his exertions,<lb/>  
and unable to move under the reaction which now came<lb/>  
over his system.</p>
            <p>The mate lay in the bottom of the boat, exhausted and<lb/>  
unable to rise, for several minutes; during that space he<lb/>  
devoutly returned thanks to God for his escape, and <lb/>bethought him of the course he was next to pursue, in order<lb/>  
to effect the rescue of his companions. The boat was<lb/>  
larger than common. It was also well equipped—a mast<lb/>  
and sail lying along with the oars, on its thwarts. The<lb/>  
rock placed Harry to windward of the wreck, and by the<lb/>  
time he felt sufficiently revived to rise and look about him,<lb/>  
his plan of proceeding was fully arranged in his own mind.<lb/>  
Among other things that he saw, as he still lay in the <lb/>bottom of the boat, was a breaker which he knew contained<lb/>  
fresh water, and a bread-bag. These were provisions that<lb/>  
it was customary for the men to make, when employed on<lb/>  
boat duty; and the articles had been left where he now<lb/>  
saw them, in the hurry of the movements, as the brig quitted<lb/>  
the islets.</p>
            <p>Harry rose the instant he felt his strength returning.<lb/>  
Striking the breaker with his foot, and feeling the basket<lb/>  
with a hand, he ascertained that the one held its water, and<lb/>  
the other its bread. This was immense relief, for by this<lb/>  
time the sufferings of the party on the wreck must be <lb/>returning with redoubled force. The mate then stepped the<lb/>  
mast, and fitted the sprit to the sail, knowing that the latter<lb/>  
would be seen fluttering in the wind by those on the wreck,<lb/>  
and carry joy to their hearts. After this considerate act,<lb/>  
he began to examine into the position of the boat. It was<lb/>  
still aground, having been left by the tide; but the water<lb/>  
had already risen several inches, and by placing himself<lb/>  
on a gunwale, so as to bring the boat on its bilge, and <lb/>pushing with an oar, he soon got it into deep water. It only<lb/>  
remained to haul aft the sheet, and right the helm, to be<lb/>  
standing through the channel, at a rate that promised a<lb/>
               <pb n="015"/>  
speedy deliverance to his friends, and, most of all, to<lb/>  
Rose.</p>
            <p>Mulford glanced past the rocks and shoals, attended by<lb/>  
the whole company of the sharks. They moved before,<lb/>  
behind, and on each side of him, as if unwilling to <lb/>abandon their prey, even after he had got beyond the limits of<lb/>  
their power to do him harm. It was not an easy thing to<lb/>  
manage the boat in that narrow and crooked channel, with<lb/>  
no other guide for the courses than the eye, and it required<lb/>  
so much of the mate's vigilance to keep clear of the sharp<lb/>  
angles of the rocks, that he could not once cast his eyes<lb/>  
aside, to look for the fluttering shawl, which now composed<lb/>  
the standing signal of the wreck. At length the boat shot<lb/>  
through the last passage of the reef, and issued into open<lb/>  
water. Mulford knew that he must come out half a mile<lb/>  
at least to leeward of his object, and, without even raising<lb/>  
his head, he flattened in the sheet, put his helm down, and<lb/>  
luffed close to the wind. Then, and then only, did he <lb/>venture to look around him.</p>
            <p>Our mate felt his heart leap toward his mouth, as he<lb/>  
observed the present state of the wreck. It was dead to<lb/>  
windward of him, in the first place, and it seemed to be<lb/>  
entirely submerged. He saw the shawl fluttering as before;<lb/>  
for Tier had fastened one corner to a button-hole of his<lb/>  
own jacket, and another to the dress of Biddy, leaving the<lb/>  
part which might be called the fly, to rise at moments<lb/>  
almost perpendicularly in the air, in a way to render it<lb/>  
visible at some distance. He saw also the heads and the<lb/>  
bodies of those on the schooner's bottom, but to him they<lb/>  
appeared to be standing in, or on, the water. The <lb/>distance may have contributed a little to this appearance, but<lb/>  
no doubt remained that so much air had escaped from the<lb/>  
hold of the vessel, as to permit it to sink altogether beneath<lb/>  
the surface of the sea. It was time, indeed, to proceed to<lb/>  
the relief of the sufferers.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the boat sailed particularly fast, and<lb/>  
worked beautifully, it could not equal the impatience of<lb/>  
Mulford to get on. Passing away to the north-east a <lb/>sufficient distance, as he thought, to weather on the wreck,<lb/>  
the young man tacked at last, and had the happiness to see<lb/>  
that every foot he proceeded was now in a direct line <lb/>toward Rose. It was only while tacking he perceived that<lb/>
               <pb n="016"/>  
all the fins had disappeared. He felt little doubt that they<lb/>  
had deserted him, in order to push for the wreck, which<lb/>  
offered so much larger, and so much more attainable prey.<lb/>  
This increased his feverish desire to get on, the boat <lb/>seeming to drag, in his eyes, at the very moment it was leaving<lb/>  
a wake full of eddies and little whirlpools. The wind was<lb/>  
steady, but it seemed to Mulford that the boat was set to<lb/>  
leeward of her course by a current, though this could<lb/>  
hardly have been the case, as the wreck, the sole mark of<lb/>  
his progress, would have had at least as great a drift as the<lb/>  
boat. At length Mulford—to him it appeared to be an age;<lb/>  
in truth it was after a run of about twenty minutes—came<lb/>  
near the goal he so earnestly sought, and got an accurate<lb/>  
view of the state of the wreck, and of those on it. The<lb/>  
hull of the schooner had, in truth, sunk entirely beneath<lb/>  
the surface of the sea; and the party it sustained stood<lb/>  
already knee-deep in the water. This was sufficiently <lb/>appalling; but the presence of the sharks, who were crowding<lb/>  
around the spot, rendered the whole scene frightful. To<lb/>  
the young mate it seemed as if he must still be too late to<lb/>  
save Rose from a fate more terrible than drowning, for his<lb/>  
boat fell so far to leeward as to compel him to tack once<lb/>  
more. As he swept past the wreck, he called out to <lb/>encourage his friends, begging them to be of good heart for<lb/>  
five minutes longer, when he should be able to reach them.<lb/>  
Rose held out her arms entreatingly, and the screams of<lb/>  
Mrs. Budd and Biddy, which were extorted by the closer<lb/>  
and closer approach of the sharks, proclaimed the <lb/>imminency of the danger they ran, and the importance of not<lb/>  
losing a moment of time.</p>
            <p>Mulford took his distance with a seaman's eye, and the<lb/>  
boat went about like a top. The latter fell off, and the sail<lb/>  
filled on the other tack. Then the young mariner saw,<lb/>  
with a joy no description can pourtray, that he looked to<lb/>  
windward of the fluttering shawl, toward which his little<lb/>  
craft was already flying. He afterward believed that shawl<lb/>  
alone prevented the voracious party of fish from assailing<lb/>  
those on the wreck, for, though there might not yet be <lb/>sufficient depth of water to allow of their customary mode of<lb/>  
attack, creatures of their voracity did not always wait for<lb/>  
such conveniences. But the boat was soon in the midst<lb/>
               <pb n="017"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
of the fins, scattering them in all directions; and Mulford<lb/>  
let go his sheet, put his helm down, and sprang forward to<lb/>  
catch the extended arms of Rose.</p>
            <p>It might have been accident, or it might have been the<lb/>  
result of skill and interest in our heroine, but certain it is,<lb/>  
that the bows of the boat came on the wreck precisely at<lb/>  
the place where Rose stood, and her hand was the first <lb/>object that the young man touched.</p>
            <p>“Take my aunt first,” cried Rose, resisting Mulford's<lb/>  
efforts to lift her into the boat; “she is dreadfully alarmed,<lb/>  
and can stand with difficulty.”</p>
            <p>Although two of Rose's activity and lightness might have<lb/>  
been drawn into the boat, while the process was going on<lb/>  
in behalf of the widow, Mulford lost no time in discussion,<lb/>  
but did as he was desired. First directing Tier to hold on<lb/>  
to the painter, he applied his strength to the arms of Mrs.<lb/>  
Budd, and, assisted by Rose and Biddy, got her safely into<lb/>  
the boat, over its bows. Rose now waited not for <lb/>assistance, but followed her aunt with a haste that proved fear<lb/>  
lent her strength in despite her long fast. Biddy came<lb/>  
next, though clumsily, and not without trouble, and Jack<lb/>  
Tier followed the instant he was permitted so to do. Of<lb/>  
course, the boat, no longer held by its painter, drifted away<lb/>  
from the spot, and the hull of the schooner, relieved from<lb/>  
the weight of four human beings, rose so near the surface<lb/>  
again as to bring a small line of its keel out of water. No<lb/>  
better evidence could have been given of the trifling power<lb/>  
which sustained it, and of the timely nature of the succour<lb/>  
brought by Mulford. Had the boat remained near the<lb/>  
schooner, it would have been found half an hour later that<lb/>  
the hull had sunk slowly out of sight, finding its way,<lb/>  
doubtless, inch by inch, toward the bottom of the Gulf.</p>
            <p>By this time the sun was well up, and the warmth of the<lb/>  
hour, season, and latitude, was shed on the sufferers.<lb/>  
There was an old sail in the boat, and in this the party<lb/>  
dried their limbs and feet, which were getting to be numb<lb/>  
by their long immersion. Then the mate produced the<lb/>  
bag and opened it, in quest of bread. A small portion was<lb/>  
given to each, and, on looking farther, the mate discovered<lb/>  
that a piece of boiled ship's beef had been secreted in this<lb/>  
receptacle. Of this also he gave each a moderate slice,<lb/>
               <pb n="018"/>  
taking a larger portion for himself, as requiring less <lb/>precaution. The suffering of the party from hunger was far less<lb/>  
than that they endured from thirst. Neither had been<lb/>  
endured long enough seriously to enfeeble them or render<lb/>  
a full meal very dangerous, but the thirst had been much<lb/>  
the hardest to be borne. Of this fact Biddy soon gave<lb/>  
audible evidence.</p>
            <p>“The mate is good,” she said, “and the bread tastes<lb/>  
swate and refreshing, but wather is a blessed thing. Can<lb/>  
you no give us one dhrap of the wather that falls from <lb/>heaven, Mr. Mulford; for this wather of the saa is of no use<lb/>  
but to drown Christians in?”</p>
            <p>In an instant the mate had opened a breaker, and filled<lb/>  
the tin pot which is almost always to be found in a boat.<lb/>  
Biddy said no more, but her eyes pleaded so eloquently,<lb/>  
that Rose begged the faithful creature might have the first<lb/>  
drink. One eager swallow went down, and then a cry of<lb/>  
disappointment succeeded. The water was salt, and had<lb/>  
been put in the breaker for ballast. The other breaker<lb/>  
was tried with the same success.</p>
            <p>“It is terrible to be without one drop of water,” <lb/>murmured Rose, “and this food makes it more necessary than<lb/>  
ever.”</p>
            <p>“Patience, patience, dearest Rose—patience for ten<lb/>  
minutes, and you shall all drink,” answered the mate, filling<lb/>  
the sail and keeping the boat away while speaking. “There<lb/>  
is water, God be praised, on the rock to which I first swam,<lb/>  
and we will secure it before another day's sun help to make<lb/>  
it evaporate.”</p>
            <p>This announcement quieted the longings of those who<lb/>  
endured a thirst which disappointment rendered doubly<lb/>  
hard to bear; and away the boat glided toward the rock.<lb/>  
As he now flew over the distance, lessened more than <lb/>one-half by the drift of the wreck, Mulford recalled the scene<lb/>  
through which he had so painfully passed the previous night.<lb/>  
As often happens, he shuddered at the recollection of things<lb/>  
which, at the moment, a desperate resolution had enabled<lb/>  
him to encounter with firmness. Still, he thought nothing<lb/>  
less than the ardent desire to save Rose could have carried<lb/>  
him through the trial with the success which attended his<lb/>  
struggles. The dear being at his side asked a few <lb/>
               <pb n="019"/>explanations of what had passed; and she bowed her head and<lb/>  
wept, equally with pain and delight, as imagination pictured<lb/>  
to her the situation of her betrothed, amid that waste of<lb/>  
water, with his fearful companions, and all in the hours of<lb/>  
deep night.</p>
            <p>But that was over now. There was the rock—the blessed<lb/>  
rock on which Mulford had so accidentally struck, close<lb/>  
before them—and presently they were all on it. The mate<lb/>  
took the pot and ran to the little reservoir, returning with<lb/>  
a sweet draught for each of the party.</p>
            <p>“A blessed, blessed thing, is wather!” exclaimed Biddy,<lb/>  
this time finding the relief she sought, “and a thousand<lb/>  
blessings on <hi rend="italics">you,</hi> Mr. Mulford, who have niver done us<lb/>  
anything but good.”</p>
            <p>Rose looked a still higher eulogy on the young man,<lb/>  
and even Mrs. Budd had something commendatory and<lb/>  
grateful to say. Jack Tier was silent, but he had all his<lb/>  
eyes about him, as he now proved.</p>
            <p>“We've all on us been so much taken up with our own<lb/>  
affairs,” remarked the steward's assistant, “that we've<lb/>  
taken but little notice of the neighbourhood. If that is n't<lb/>  
the brig, Mr. Mulford, running through this very passage,<lb/>  
with stun'sails set alow and aloft, I do n't know the Molly<lb/>  
Swash when I see her!”</p>
            <p>“The brig!” exclaimed the mate, recollecting the vessels<lb/>  
he had seen at the break-of-day, for the first time in hours.<lb/>  
“Can it be possible that the craft I made out to the <lb/>southward, is the brig?”</p>
            <p>“Look, and judge for yourself, sir. There she comes,<lb/>  
like a race-horse, and if she holds her present course, she<lb/>  
must pass somewhere within a mile or so of us, if we stay<lb/>  
where we are.”</p>
            <p>Mulford did look, as did all with him. There was the<lb/>  
Swash, sure enough, coming down before the wind, and<lb/>  
under a cloud of canvas. She might be still a league, or<lb/>  
a league and a half distant, but, at the rate at which she<lb/>  
was travelling, that distance would soon be past. She was<lb/>  
running through the passage, no doubt with a view to <lb/>proceed to the Dry Tortugas, to look after the schooner, Spike<lb/>  
having the hope that he had dodged his pursuers on the<lb/>  
coast of Cuba. The mate now looked for the ship, in the<lb/>
               <pb n="020"/>  
north-western board, believing, as he did, that she was the<lb/>  
sloop-of-war. That vessel had gone about, and was <lb/>standing to the southward, on a taut bowline. She was still a<lb/>  
long way off, three or four leagues at least, but the change<lb/>  
she had made in her position, since last seen, proved that<lb/>  
she was a great sailer. Then she was more than hull down,<lb/>  
whereas, now, she was near enough to let the outline of a<lb/>  
long, straight fabric be discovered beneath her canvas.</p>
            <p>“It is hardly possible that Spike should not see the vessel<lb/>  
here in the northern board,” Mulford observed to Tier,<lb/>  
who had been examining the ship with him. “The <lb/>look-out is usually good on board the Swash, and, just now,<lb/>  
should certainly be as good as common. Spike is no <lb/>dawdler with serious business before him.”</p>
            <p>“He's a willain!” muttered Jack Tier.</p>
            <p>The mate regarded his companion with some surprise.<lb/>  
Jack was a very insignificant-looking personage in common,<lb/>  
and one would scarcely pause to give him a second look,<lb/>  
unless it might be to laugh at his rotundity and little <lb/>waddling legs. But, now, the mate fancied he was swelling<lb/>  
with feelings that actually imparted somewhat more than<lb/>  
usual stature and dignity to his appearance. His face was<lb/>  
full of indignation, and there was something about the eye,<lb/>  
that to Mulford was inexplicable. As Rose, however, had<lb/>  
related to him the scene that took place on the islet, at the<lb/>  
moment when Spike was departing, the mate supposed that<lb/>  
Jack still felt a portion of the resentment that such a <lb/>collision would be apt to create. From the expression of<lb/>  
Jack's countenance at that instant, it struck him Spike<lb/>  
might not be exactly safe, should accident put it in the<lb/>  
power of the former to do him an injury.</p>
            <p>It was now necessary to decide on the course that ought<lb/>  
to be pursued. The bag contained sufficient food to last<lb/>  
the party several days, and a gallon of water still remained<lb/>  
in the cavity of the rock. This last was collected and put<lb/>  
in one of the breakers, which was emptied of the salt water<lb/>  
in order to receive it. As water, however, was the great<lb/>  
necessity in that latitude, Mulford did not deem it prudent<lb/>  
to set sail with so small a supply, and he accordingly <lb/>commenced a search, on some of the adjacent rocks, Jack Tier<lb/>  
accompanying him. They succeeded in doubling their stock<lb/>
               <pb n="021"/>  
of water, and collected several shell-fish, that the females<lb/>  
found exceedingly grateful and refreshing. On the score of<lb/>  
hunger and thirst, indeed, no one was now suffering. By<lb/>  
judiciously sipping a little water at a time, and retaining it<lb/>  
in the mouth before swallowing, the latter painful feeling<lb/>  
had been gotten rid of; and as for food, there was even<lb/>  
more than was actually needed, and that of a very good<lb/>  
quality. It is probable that standing in the water for hours,<lb/>  
as Rose, and her aunt, and Biddy had been obliged to do,<lb/>  
had contributed to lessen the pain endured from thirst,<lb/>  
though they had all suffered a good deal from that cause,<lb/>  
especially while the sun shone.</p>
            <p>Mulford and Tier were half an hour in obtaining the<lb/>  
water. By the end of that period the brigantine was so<lb/>  
near as to render her hull distinctly visible. It was high<lb/>  
time to decide on their future course. The sail had been<lb/>  
brailed when the boat reached the rock, and the boat itself<lb/>  
lay on the side of the latter opposite to the brig, and where<lb/>  
no part of it could be seen to those on board the Swash,<lb/>  
with the exception of the mast. Under the circumstances,<lb/>  
therefore, Mulford thought it wisest to remain where they<lb/>  
were, and let the vessel pass, before they attempted to <lb/>proceed toward Key West, their intended place of refuge. In<lb/>  
order to do this, however, it was necessary to cause the<lb/>  
whole party to lie down, in such a way as to be hid by<lb/>  
the inequalities in the rock, as it was now very evident the<lb/>  
brig would pass within half a mile of them. Hitherto, it<lb/>  
was not probable that they had been seen, and by using due<lb/>  
caution, the chances of Spike's overlooking them altogether<lb/>  
amounted nearly to certainty.</p>
            <p>The necessary arrangements were soon made, the boat's<lb/>  
masts unstepped, the party placed behind their covers, and<lb/>  
the females comfortably bestowed in the spare sail, where<lb/>  
they might got a little undisturbed sleep after the dreadful<lb/>  
night, or morning, they had passed. Even Jack Tier lay<lb/>  
down to catch his nap, as the most useful manner of <lb/>bestowing himself for a couple of hours; the time Mulford had<lb/>  
mentioned as the period of their stay where they were.</p>
            <p>As for the mate, vigilance was his portion, and he took<lb/>  
his position, hid like all the rest, where he could watch the<lb/>  
movements of his old craft. In about twenty minutes, the<lb/>
               <pb n="022"/>  
brig was quite near; so near that Mulford not only saw<lb/>  
the people on board her, who showed themselves in the<lb/>  
rigging, but fancied he could recognise their persons. As<lb/>  
yet, nothing had occurred in the way of change, but, just<lb/>  
as the Swash got abreast of the rock, she began to take in<lb/>  
her studding-sails, and that hurriedly, as is apt to occur on<lb/>  
board a vessel in sudden emergencies. Our young man<lb/>  
was a little alarmed at first, believing that they might have<lb/>  
been discovered, but he was soon induced to think that the<lb/>  
crew of the brigantine had just then begun to suspect the<lb/>  
character of the ship to the northward. That vessel had<lb/>  
been drawing near all this time, and was now only some<lb/>  
three leagues distant. Owing to the manner in which she<lb/>  
headed, or bows on, it was not a very easy matter to tell<lb/>  
the character of this stranger, though the symmetry and<lb/>  
squareness of his yards rendered it nearly certain he was<lb/>  
a cruiser. Though Spike could not expect to meet his old<lb/>  
acquaintance here, after the chase he had so lately led her,<lb/>  
down on the opposite coast, he might and would have his<lb/>  
misgivings, and Mulford thought it was his intention to<lb/>  
haul up close round the northern angle of the reef, and<lb/>  
maintain his advantage of the wind, over the stranger. If<lb/>  
this were actually done, it might expose the boat to view,<lb/>  
for the brig would pass within a quarter of a mile of it, and<lb/>  
on the side of the rock on which it lay. It was too late,<lb/>  
however, to attempt a change, since the appearance of<lb/>  
human beings in such a place would be certain to draw the<lb/>  
brig's glasses on them, and the glasses must at once let<lb/>  
Spike know who they were. It remained, therefore, only<lb/>  
to await the result as patiently as possible.</p>
            <p>A very few minutes removed all doubt. The brig hauled<lb/>  
as close round the reef as she dared to venture, and in a<lb/>  
very short time the boat lay exposed to view to all on board<lb/>  
her. The vessel was now so near that Mulford plainly saw<lb/>  
the boatswain get upon the coach-house, or little <lb/>hurricane-house deck, where Spike stood examining the ship with<lb/>  
his glass, and point out the boat, where it lay at the side<lb/>  
of the rock. In an instant, the glass was levelled at the<lb/>  
spot, and the movements on board the brig immediately<lb/>  
betrayed to Mulford that the boat was recognised. Sail<lb/>  
was shortened on board the Swash, and men were seen<lb/>
               <pb n="023"/>  
preparing to lower her stern boat, while everything <lb/>indicated that the vessel was about to be hove-to. There was<lb/>  
no time now to be lost, but the young man immediately<lb/>  
gave the alarm.</p>
            <p>No sooner did the party arise and show themselves, than<lb/>  
the crew of the Swash gave three cheers. By the aid of<lb/>  
the glass, Spike doubtless recognised their persons, and<lb/>  
the fact was announced to the men, by way of stimulating<lb/>  
their exertions. This gave an additional spur to the <lb/>movements of those on the rock, who hastened into their own<lb/>  
boat, and made sail as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>It was far easier to do all that has been described, than<lb/>  
to determine on the future course. Capture was certain<lb/>  
if the fugitives ventured into the open water, and their<lb/>  
only hope was to remain on the reef. If channels for the<lb/>  
passage of the boat could be found, escape was highly <lb/>probable, as the schooner's boat could sail much faster than<lb/>  
the brig's boat could row, fast as Mulford knew the last to<lb/>  
be. But the experience of the morning had told the mate<lb/>  
that the rock rose too near the surface, in many places, for<lb/>  
the boat, small as it was, to pass over it; and he must trust<lb/>  
a great deal to chance. Away he went, however, <lb/>standing along a narrow channel, through which the wind just<lb/>  
permitted him to lay, with the sail occasionally shaking.</p>
            <p>By this time the Swash had her boat in the water,<lb/>  
manned with four powerful oars, Spike steering it in his<lb/>  
own person. Our young mate placed Tier in the bows, to<lb/>  
point out the deepest water, and kept his sail a rap full, in<lb/>  
order to get ahead as fast as possible. Ahead he did get,<lb/>  
but it was on a course that soon brought him out in the<lb/>  
open water of the main passage through the reef, leaving<lb/>  
Spike materially astern. The latter now rose in his boat,<lb/>  
and made a signal with his hat, which the boatswain <lb/>perfectly understood. The latter caused the brig to ware short<lb/>  
round on her heel, and boarded his foretack in chase, <lb/>hauling up into the passage as soon as he could again round<lb/>  
the reef. Mulford soon saw that it would never do for him<lb/>  
to venture far from the rocks, the brig going two feet to<lb/>  
his one, though not looking quite as high as he did in the<lb/>  
boat. But the Swash had her guns, and it was probable<lb/>  
they would be used rather than he should escape. When<lb/>
               <pb n="024"/>  
distant two hundred yards from the reef, therefore, he<lb/>  
tacked. The new course brought the fugitives nearly at<lb/>  
right angles to that steered by Spike, who stood directly on,<lb/>  
as if conscious that, sooner or later, such a rencounter<lb/>  
must occur. It would seem that the tide was setting through<lb/>  
the passage, for when the boat of Mulford again reached<lb/>  
the reef, it was considerably to windward of the channel<lb/>  
out of which she had issued, and opposite to another which<lb/>  
offered very opportunely for her entrance. Into this new<lb/>  
channel, then, the mate somewhat blindly ran, feeling the<lb/>  
necessity of getting out of gun-shot of the brig at every<lb/>  
hazard. She at least could not follow him among the rocks,<lb/>  
let Spike, in his boat, proceed as he might.</p>
            <p>According to appearances, Spike was not likely to be<lb/>  
very successful. He was obliged to diverge from his course,<lb/>  
in order to go into the main passage at the very point<lb/>  
where Mulford had just before done the same thing, and<lb/>  
pull along the reef to windward, in order to get into the<lb/>  
new channel, into which the boat he was pursuing had just<lb/>  
entered. This brought him not only astern again, but a<lb/>  
long bit astern, inasmuch as he was compelled to make the<lb/>  
circuit described. On he went, however, as eager in the<lb/>  
chase as the hound with his game in view.</p>
            <p>Mulford's boat seemed to fly, and glided ahead at least<lb/>  
three feet to that of Spike's two. The direction of the<lb/>  
channel it was in, brought it pretty close to the wind, but<lb/>  
the water was quite smooth, and our mate managed to keep<lb/>  
the sail full, and his little craft at the same time quite near<lb/>  
the weatherly side of the rocks. In the course of ten<lb/>  
minutes the fugitives were fully a mile from the brig, which<lb/>  
was unable to follow them, but kept standing off and on,<lb/>  
in the main passage, waiting the result. At one time <lb/>Mulford thought the channel would bring him out into open<lb/>  
water again, on the northern side of the reef, and more<lb/>  
than a mile to the eastward of the point where the <lb/>ship-channel in which the Swash was plying commenced; but<lb/>  
an accidental circumstance prevented his standing in far<lb/>  
enough to ascertain the fact. That circumstance was as<lb/>  
follows:</p>
            <p>In running a mile and a half over the reef, in the <lb/>manner described, Mulford had left the boat of Spike quite half<lb/>
               <pb n="025"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
a mile astern. He was now out of gun-shot from the brig,<lb/>  
or at least beyond the range of her grape, the only missile<lb/>  
he feared, and so far to windward that he kept his eye on<lb/>  
every opening to the southward, which he fancied might<lb/>  
allow of his making a stretch deeper into the mazes of the<lb/>  
reef, among which he believed it easiest for him to escape,<lb/>  
and to weary the oarsmen of his pursuers. Two or three<lb/>  
of these openings offered as he glided along, but it struck<lb/>  
him that they all looked so high that the boat would not<lb/>  
lay through them—an opinion in which he was right. At<lb/>  
length he came abreast of one that seemed straight and<lb/>  
clear of obstacles as far as he could see, and through which<lb/>  
he might run with a flowing sheet. Down went his helm,<lb/>  
and about went his boat, running away to the southward as<lb/>  
fast as ever.</p>
            <p>Had Spike followed, doubled the same shoal, and kept<lb/>  
away again in the same channel as had been done by the<lb/>  
boat he chased, all his hopes of success must have vanished<lb/>  
at once. This he did not attempt, therefore; but, sheering<lb/>  
into one of the openings which the mate had rejected, he<lb/>  
cut off quite half a mile in his distance. This was easy<lb/>  
enough for him to accomplish, as a row-boat would pull<lb/>  
even easier, near to the wind, than with the wind broad on<lb/>  
its bow. In consequence of this short cut, therefore, Spike<lb/>  
was actually crossing out into Mulford's new channel, just<lb/>  
as the latter had handsomely cleared the mouth of the<lb/>  
opening through which he effected his purpose.</p>
            <p>It is scarcely necessary to say that the two boats must<lb/>  
have been for a few minutes quite near to each other; so<lb/>  
near, indeed, did the fugitives now pass to their pursuers,<lb/>  
that it would have been easy for them to have conversed,<lb/>  
had they been so disposed. Not a word was spoken, <lb/>however, but Mulford went by, leaving Spike about a hundred<lb/>  
yards astern. This was a trying moment to the latter, and<lb/>  
the devil tempted him to seek his revenge. He had not<lb/>  
come unarmed on his enterprise, but three or four loaded<lb/>  
muskets lay in the stern-sheets of his yawl. He looked at<lb/>  
his men, and saw that they could not hold out much longer<lb/>  
to pull as they had been pulling. Then he looked at <lb/>Mulford's boat, and saw it gliding away from him at a rate that<lb/>  
would shortly place it another half mile in advance. He<lb/>
               <pb n="026"/>  
seized a musket, and raised it to his shoulder, nay, was in<lb/>  
the act of taking aim at his mate, when Rose, who watched<lb/>  
his movements, threw herself before Harry, and if she did<lb/>  
not actually save his life, at least prevented Spike's attempt<lb/>  
on it for that occasion. In the course of the next ten<lb/>  
minutes the fugitives had again so far gained on their <lb/>pursuers, that the latter began to see that their efforts were<lb/>  
useless. Spike muttered a few bitter curses, and told his<lb/>  
men to lay on their oars.</p>
            <p>“It's well for the runaway,” he added, “that the gal put<lb/>  
herself between us, else would his grog have been stopped<lb/>  
for ever. I've long suspected this; but had I been sure<lb/>  
of it, the Gulf Stream would have had the keeping of his<lb/>  
body, the first dark night we were in it together. Lay on<lb/>  
your oars, men, lay on your oars; I'm afeared the villian<lb/>  
will get through our fingers, a'ter all.”</p>
            <p>The men obeyed, and then, for the first time, did they<lb/>  
turn their heads, to look at those they had been so <lb/>vehemently pursuing. The other boat was quite half a mile<lb/>  
from them, and it had again tacked. This last occurrence<lb/>  
induced Spike to pull slowly ahead, in quest of another<lb/>  
short passage to cut the fugitives off; but no such opening<lb/>  
offered.</p>
            <p>“There he goes about again, by George!” exclaimed<lb/>  
Spike. “Give way, lads—give way; an easy stroke, for<lb/>  
if he is embayed, he can't escape us!”</p>
            <p>Sure enough, poor Mulford <hi rend="italics">was</hi> embayed, and could see<lb/>  
no outlet by which to pass ahead. He tacked his boat two<lb/>  
or three times, and he wore round as often; but on every<lb/>  
side shoals, or rocks that actually rose above the surface<lb/>  
of the water, impeded his course. The fact was not to be<lb/>  
concealed; after all his efforts, and so many promises of<lb/>  
success, not only was his further progress ahead cut off,<lb/>  
but equally so was retreat. The passage was not wide<lb/>  
enough to admit the hope of getting by his pursuers, and<lb/>  
the young man came to the conclusion that his better course<lb/>  
was to submit with dignity to his fate. For himself he had<lb/>  
no hope—he knew Spike's character too well for that; but<lb/>  
he did not apprehend any great immediate danger to his<lb/>  
companions. Spike had a coarse, brutal admiration for<lb/>  
Rose! but her expected fortune, which was believed to be<lb/>
               <pb n="027"/>  
of more amount than was actually the case, was a sort of<lb/>  
pledge that he would not willingly put himself in a situation<lb/>  
that would prevent the possibility of enjoying it. Strange,<lb/>  
hurried, and somewhat confused thoughts passed through<lb/>  
Harry Mulford's mind, as he brailed his sail, and waited<lb/>  
for his captors to approach and take possession of his boat<lb/>  
and himself. This was done quietly, and with very few<lb/>  
words on the part of Spike.</p>
            <p>Mulford would have liked the appearance of things better<lb/>  
had his old commander cursed him, and betrayed other<lb/>  
signs of the fury that was boiling in his very soul. On the<lb/>  
contrary, never had Stephen Spike seemed more calm, or<lb/>  
under better self-command. He smiled, and saluted Mrs.<lb/>  
Budd, just as if nothing unpleasant had occurred, and <lb/>alluded to the sharpness of the chase with facetiousness and<lb/>  
seeming good-humour. The females were deceived by this<lb/>  
manner, and hoped, after all, that the worst that would<lb/>  
happen would be a return to their old position on board the<lb/>  
Swash. This was being so much better off than their <lb/>horrible situation on the wreck, that the change was not<lb/>  
frightful to them.</p>
            <p>“What has become of the schooner, Mr. Mulford?”<lb/>  
asked Spike, as the boats began to pass down the channel<lb/>  
to return to the brig—two of the Swash's men taking their<lb/>  
seats in that which had been captured, along with their<lb/>  
commander, while the other two got a tow from the use<lb/>  
of the sail. “I see you have the boat here that we used<lb/>  
alongside of her, and suppose you know something of the<lb/>  
craft itself.”</p>
            <p>“She capsized with us in a squall,” answered the mate,<lb/>  
“and we only left the wreck this morning.”</p>
            <p>“Capsized!—hum—that was a hard fate, to be sure, and<lb/>  
denotes bad seamanship. Now I've sailed all sorts of craft<lb/>  
these forty years, or five-and-thirty at least, and never <lb/>capsized anything in my life. Stand by there for'ard to hold<lb/>  
on by that rock.”</p>
            <p>A solitary cap of the coral rose above the water two or<lb/>  
three feet, close to the channel, and was the rock to which<lb/>  
Spike alluded. It was only some fifty feet in diameter, and<lb/>  
of an oval form, rising quite above the ordinary tides, as<lb/>  
was apparent by its appearance. It is scarcely necessary<lb/>
               <pb n="028"/>  
to say it had no other fresh water than that which <lb/>occasionally fell on its surface, which surface being quite smooth,<lb/>  
retained very little of the rain it received. The boat was<lb/>  
soon alongside of this rock, where it was held broadside-to<lb/>  
by the two seamen.</p>
            <p>“Mr. Mulford, do me the favour to step up here,” said<lb/>  
Spike, leading the way on to the rock himself. “I have a<lb/>  
word to say to you before we get on board the old Molly<lb/>  
once more.”</p>
            <p>Mulford silently complied, fully expecting that Spike<lb/>  
intended to blow his brains out, and willing the bloody<lb/>  
deed should be done in a way to be as little shocking to<lb/>  
Rose as circumstances would allow. But Spike manifested<lb/>  
no such intention. A more refined cruelty was uppermost<lb/>  
in his mind; and his revenge was calculated, and took care<lb/>  
to fortify itself with some of the quibbles and artifices of<lb/>  
the law. He might not be exactly right in his legal <lb/>reservations, but he did not the less rely on their virtue.</p>
            <p>“Hark'e, Mr. Mulford,” said Spike, sharply, as soon as<lb/>  
both were on the rock, “you have run from my brig,<lb/>  
thereby showing your distaste for her; and I've no <lb/>disposition to keep a man who wishes to quit me. Here you<lb/>  
are, sir, on <hi rend="italics">terrum firm,</hi> as the scholars call it; and here<lb/>  
you have my full permission to remain. I wish you a good<lb/>  
morning, sir; and will not fail to report, when we get in,<lb/>  
that you left the brig of your own pleasure.”</p>
            <p>“You will not have the cruelty to abandon me on this<lb/>  
naked rock, Captain Spike, and that without a morsel of<lb/>  
food, or a drop of water.”</p>
            <p>“Wather is a blessed thing!” exclaimed Biddy. “Do not<lb/>  
think of lavin' the gentleman widout wather.”</p>
            <p>“You left <hi rend="italics">me,</hi> sir, without food or water, and you can<lb/>  
fit out your own rock—yes, d—e, sir, you left me <hi rend="italics">under fire,  
 </hi>
               <lb/> and that is a thing no true-hearted man would have thought<lb/>  
of. Stand by to make sail, boys; and if he offer to enter<lb/>  
the boat, pitch him out with the boat-hooks.”</p>
            <p>Spike was getting angry, and he entered the boat again,<lb/>  
without perceiving that Rose had left it. Light of foot,<lb/>  
and resolute of spirit, the beautiful girl, handsomer than<lb/>  
ever perhaps, by her excited feelings and dishevelled hair,<lb/>  
had sprung on the rock, as Spike stepped into the boat<lb/>
               <pb n="029"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
forward, and when the latter turned round, after loosening<lb/>  
the sail, he found he was drifting away from the very being<lb/>  
who was the object of all his efforts. Mulford, believing<lb/>  
that Rose was to be abandoned as well as himself, received<lb/>  
the noble girl in his arms, though ready to implore Spike,<lb/>  
on his knees, to return and at least to take her off. But<lb/>  
Spike wanted no solicitation on that point. He returned<lb/>  
of his own accord, and had just reached the rock again<lb/>  
when a report of a gun drew all eyes toward the brig.</p>
            <p>The Swash had again run out of the passage, and was<lb/>  
beating up, close to the reef as she dared to go, with a<lb/>  
signal flying. All the seamen at once understood the cause<lb/>  
of this hint. The strange sail was getting too near, and<lb/>  
everybody could see that it was the sloop-of-war. Spike<lb/>  
looked at Rose, a moment, in doubt. But Mulford raised<lb/>  
his beloved in his arms, and carried her to the side of the<lb/>  
rock, stepping on board the boat.</p>
            <p>Spike watched the movements of the young man with<lb/>  
jealous vigilance, and no sooner was Rose placed on her<lb/>  
seat, than he motioned significantly to the mate to quit the<lb/>  
boat.</p>
            <p>“I cannot and will not voluntarily, Captain Spike,”<lb/>  
answered Harry, calmly. “It would be committing a sort<lb/>  
of suicide.”</p>
            <p>A sign brought two of the men to the captain's assistance.<lb/>  
While the latter held Rose in her place, the sailors shoved<lb/>  
Harry on the rock again. Had Mulford been disposed to<lb/>  
resist, these two men could not very easily have ejected him<lb/>  
from the boat, if they could have done it at all; but he knew<lb/>  
there were others in reserve, and feared that blood might<lb/>  
be shed, in the irritated state of Spike, in the presence of<lb/>  
Rose. While, therefore, he would not be accessary to his<lb/>  
own destruction, he would not engage in what he knew<lb/>  
would prove not only a most harassing, but a bootless <lb/>resistance. The consequence was that the boats proceeded,<lb/>  
leaving him alone on the rock.</p>
            <p>It was perhaps fortunate for Rose that she fainted. Her<lb/>  
condition occupied her aunt and Biddy, and Spike was<lb/>  
enabled to reach his brig without any further interruption.<lb/>  
Rose was taken on board still nearly insensible, while her<lb/>  
two female companions were so much confused and <lb/>
               <pb n="030"/>distressed, that neither could have given a reasonably clear<lb/>  
account of what had just occurred. Not so with Jack<lb/>  
Tier, however. That singular being noted all that passed,<lb/>  
seated in the eyes of the boat, away from the confusion<lb/>  
that prevailed in its stern-sheets, and apparently undisturbed<lb/>  
by it.</p>
            <p>As the party was sailing back toward the brig, the <lb/>light-house boat towing the Swash's yawl, Jack took as good an<lb/>  
observation of the channels of that part of the reef as his<lb/>  
low position would allow. He tried to form in his mind a<lb/>  
sort of chart of the spot, for, from the instant Mulford was<lb/>  
thus deserted, the little fellow had formed a stern resolution<lb/>  
to attempt his rescue. How that was to be done, however,<lb/>  
was more than he yet knew; and when they reached the<lb/>  
brig's side, Tier may be said to have been filled with good<lb/>  
intentions, rather than with any very available knowledge<lb/>  
to enable him to put them in execution.</p>
            <p>As respects the two vessels, the arrival of Spike on board<lb/>  
his own was not a moment too soon. The Poughkeepsie,<lb/>  
for the stranger to the northward was now ascertained to<lb/>  
be that sloop-of-war, was within long gun-shot by this time,<lb/>  
and near enough to make certain, by means of her glasses,<lb/>  
of the character of the craft with which she was closing.<lb/>  
Luckily for the brig she lay in the channel so often <lb/>mentioned, and through which both she and her present pursuer<lb/>  
had so lately come, on their way to the northward. This<lb/>  
brought her to windward, as the wind then stood, with a<lb/>  
clear passage before her. Not a moment was lost. No<lb/>  
sooner were the females sent below, than sail was made on<lb/>  
the brig, and she began to beat through the passage, making<lb/>  
long legs and short ones. She was chased, as a matter of<lb/>  
course, and that hard, the difference in sailing between the<lb/>  
two crafts not being sufficiently great to render the <lb/>brigantine's escape by any means certain, while absolutely within<lb/>  
the range of those terrible missiles that were used by the<lb/>  
man-of-war's men.</p>
            <p>But Spike soon determined not to leave a point so delicate<lb/>  
as that of his own and his vessel's security to be decided<lb/>  
by a mere superiority in the way of heels. The Florida<lb/>  
Reef, with all its dangers, windings, and rocks, was as well<lb/>  
known to him as the entrances to the port of New York.<lb/>
               <pb n="031"/>  
In addition to its larger channels, of which there are three<lb/>  
or four, through which ships of size can pass, it had many<lb/>  
others that would admit only vessels of a lighter draught<lb/>  
of water. The brig was not flying light, it is true, but she<lb/>  
was merely in good ballast trim, and passages would be<lb/>  
available to her, into which the Poughkeepsie would not<lb/>  
dare to venture. One of these lesser channels was favourably<lb/>  
placed to further the escape of Spike, and he shoved the<lb/>  
brig into it after the struggle had lasted less than an hour.<lb/>  
This passage offered a shorter cut to the south side of the<lb/>  
reef than the main channel, and the sloop-of-war, doubtless<lb/>  
perceiving the uselessness of pursuit, under such <lb/>circumstances, wore round on her heel, and came down through<lb/>  
the main channel again, just entering the open water, near<lb/>  
the spot where the schooner had sunk, as the sun was setting.</p>

            <p>As for Spike, he had no intention of going to the <lb/>southward of the Florida Reef again until his business called<lb/>  
him there. The lost bag of doubloons was still gleaming<lb/>  
before his imagination, and no sooner did the Poughkeepsie<lb/>  
bear up, than he shortened sail, standing back and forth<lb/>  
in his narrow and crooked channel, rather losing ground<lb/>  
than gaining, though he took great pains not to let his artifice<lb/>  
be seen. When the Poughkeepsie was so far to the <lb/>northward as to render it safe, he took in everything but one or<lb/>  
two of his lowest sails, and followed easily in the same<lb/>  
direction. As the sloop-of-war carried her light and loftier<lb/>  
sails, she remained visible to the people of the Swash long<lb/>  
after the Swash had ceased to be visible to her. Profiting<lb/>
               <pb n="032"/>  
by this circumstance, Spike entered the main channel again<lb/>  
some time before it was dark, and selected a safe anchorage<lb/>  
there that was well known to him; a spot where sufficient<lb/>  
sand had collected on the coral to make good holding<lb/>  
ground, and where a vessel would be nearly embayed,<lb/>  
though always to windward of her channel going out, by<lb/>  
the formation of the reef. Here he anchored, in order to<lb/>  
wait until morning ere he ventured further north. During<lb/>  
the whole of that dreadful day, Rose had remained in her<lb/>  
cabin, disconsolate, nearly unable, as she was absolutely<lb/>  
unwilling to converse. Now it was that she felt the total<lb/>  
insufficiency of a mind feeble as that of her aunt's to<lb/>  
administer consolation to misery like her own. Nevertheless,<lb/>  
the affectionate solicitude of Mrs. Budd, as well as that of<lb/>  
the faithful creature, Biddy, brought some relief, and reason<lb/>  
and resignation began slowly to resume their influence.<lb/>  
Yet was the horrible picture of Harry, dying by inches,<lb/>  
deserted in the midst of the waters on his solitary rock,<lb/>  
ever present to her thoughts, until, once or twice, her feelings<lb/>  
verged on madness. Prayer brought its customary relief,<lb/>  
however; and we do not think that we much exaggerate<lb/>  
the fact, when we say that Rose passed fully one-half of<lb/>  
that terrible afternoon on her knees.</p>
            <p>As for Jack Tier, he was received on board the brig<lb/>  
much as if nothing had happened. Spike passed and<lb/>  
repassed him fifty times, without even an angry look, or a<lb/>  
word of abuse; and the deputy-steward dropped quietly into<lb/>  
the duties of his office, without meeting with either reproach<lb/>  
or hindrance. The only allusion, indeed, that was made<lb/>  
to his recent adventures, took place in a conversation that<lb/>  
was held on the subject in the galley, the interlocutors being<lb/>  
Jack himself, Josh, the steward, and Simon, the cook.</p>
            <p>“Where you been scullin' to, 'bout on dat reef, Jack,<lb/>  
wid dem' ere women, I won'er now?” demanded Josh, after<lb/>  
tasting the cabin soup, in order to ascertain how near it<lb/>  
was to being done. “It'ink it no great fun to dodge 'bout<lb/>  
among dem rock in a boat, for anudder hurricane might<lb/>  
come when a body least expeck him.”</p>
            <p>“Oh,” said Jack, cavalierly, “two hurricanes no more<lb/>  
come in one month, than two shot in the same hole. We've<lb/>
               <pb n="033"/>  
been turtlin', that's all. I wish we had in your coppers,<lb/>  
cook, some of the critturs that we fell in with in our cruise.”</p>
            <p>“Wish'e had, master steward, wid all my heart,” answered<lb/>  
the fat, glistening potentate of the galley. “But, hark'ee,<lb/>  
Jack; what became of our young mate, can 'e tell? Some<lb/>  
say he get kill at'e Dry Tortugas, and some say he war'<lb/>  
scullin' round in dat boat you hab, wid'e young woman,<lb/>  
eh?”</p>
            <p>“Ah, boys,” answered Jack, mournfully, “sure enough,<lb/>  
what <hi rend="italics">has</hi> become of him?”</p>
            <p>“You know, why can't you tell? What good to hab<lb/>  
secret among friend.”</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="italics">Are</hi> ye his friends, lads? Do you really feel as if you<lb/>  
could give a poor soul in its agony a helpin' hand?”</p>
            <p>“Why not?” said Josh, in a reproachful way. “Misser<lb/>  
Mulford'e bess mate dis brig ebber get; and I don't see why<lb/>  
Cap'in Spike-want to be rid of him.”</p>
            <p>“Because he's a willian!” returned Jack between his<lb/>  
grated teeth. “D'ye know what that means in English,<lb/>  
master Josh; and can you and cook here, both of whom<lb/>  
have sailed with the man years in and years out, say whether<lb/>  
my words be true or not?”</p>
            <p>“Dat as a body understand 'em. Accordin' to some<lb/>  
rule, Stephen Spike not a werry honest man; but accordin'<lb/>  
to 'nudder some, he as good as any body else.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, dat just be upshot of de matter,” put in Simon,<lb/>  
approvingly. “De whole case lie in dat meanin'.”</p>
            <p>“D'ye call it right to leave a human being to starve, or<lb/>  
to suffer for water, on a naked rock, in the midst of the<lb/>  
ocean?”</p>
            <p>“Who do dat?”</p>
            <p>“The willian who is captain of this brig; and all because<lb/>  
he thinks young eyes and bloomin' cheeks prefar young<lb/>  
eyes and bloomin' cheeks to his own grizzly beard and old<lb/>  
look-outs.”</p>
            <p>“Dat bad; dat werry bad,” said Josh, shaking his head,<lb/>  
a way of denoting dissatisfaction, in which Simon joined<lb/>  
him; for no crime appeared sufficiently grave in the eyes<lb/>  
of these two sleek and well-fed officials to justify such a<lb/>  
punishment. “Dat mons'ous bad, and cap'in ought to know<lb/>  
better dan do <hi rend="italics">dat</hi>. I nebber starves a mouse, if I catches<lb/>
               <pb n="034"/>  
him in de bread-locker. Now, dat a sort of reason'ble<lb/>  
punishment, too; but I nebber does it. If mouse eat my<lb/>  
bread, it do seem right to tell mouse dat he hab enough,<lb/>  
and dat he must not eat any more for a week, or a mont',<lb/>  
but it too cruel for me, and I nebber does it; no, I t'rows<lb/>  
de little debil overboard, and lets him drown like a <lb/>gentle'em.”</p>
            <p>“Y-e-s,” drawled out Simon, in a philanthropical tone of<lb/>  
voice, “dat'e best way. What good it do to torment a<lb/>  
fellow critter? If Misser Mulford run, why put him down<lb/>  
run, and let him go, I say, on'y mulk his wages; but what<lb/>  
good it do anybody to starve him? Now dis is my opinion,<lb/>  
gentle'em, and dat is, dat starwation be wuss dan choleric.<lb/>  
Choleric kill, I knows, and so does starwation kill; but of<lb/>  
de two, gib me de choleric fuss; if I gets well of dat, den<lb/>  
try starwation if you can.”</p>
            <p>“I'm glad to hear you talk in this manner, my hearties,”<lb/>  
put in Jack; “and I hope I may find you accommodatin'<lb/>  
in a plan I've got to help the maty out of this difficulty. As<lb/>  
a friend of Stephen Spike's I would do it; for it must be a<lb/>  
terrible thing to die with such a murder on one's soul.<lb/>  
Here's the boat that we pick'd up at the light-house, yonder,<lb/>  
in tow of the brig at this minute; and there's everything<lb/>  
in her comfortable for a good long run, as I know from<lb/>  
having sailed in her; and what I mean is this: as we left<lb/>  
Mr. Mulford, I took the bearings and distance of the rock<lb/>  
he was on, d'ye understand, and think I could find my way<lb/>  
back to it. You see the brig is travelin' slowly north ag'in,<lb/>  
and afore long we shall be in the neighbourhood of that<lb/>  
very rock. We, cook and stewards, will be called on to<lb/>  
keep an anchor-watch, if the brig fetches up, as I heard the<lb/>  
captain tell the Spanish gentleman he thought she would;<lb/>  
and then we can take the boat that's in the water and go<lb/>  
and have a hunt for the maty.”</p>
            <p>The two blacks looked at Tier earnestly; then they<lb/>  
turned their heads to look at each other. The idea struck<lb/>  
each as bold and novel, but each saw serious difficulties in<lb/>  
it. At length Josh, as became his superior station, took<lb/>  
on himself the office of expressing the objections that <lb/>occurred to his mind.</p>
            <p>“Dat nebber do!” exclaimed the steward. “We be's<lb/>
               <pb n="035"/>  
quite willin' to sarve'e mate, who's a good gentle'em, and<lb/>  
as nice a young man as ever sung out, ‘hard a-lee,” but we<lb/>  
must t'ink little bit of number one; or, for dat matter, of<lb/>  
number two, as Simon would be implercated as well as<lb/>  
myself. If Cap'in Spike once knew we've lent a hand in<lb/>  
sich a job, he'd never overlook it. I knows him, <hi rend="italics">well;  
 </hi>
               <lb/> and that is sayin' as much as need be said of any man's<lb/>  
character. You nebber catch <hi rend="italics">me</hi> runnin' myself into his<lb/>  
jaws; would rather fight a shark widout any knife. No,<lb/>  
no—I knows him <hi rend="italics">well</hi>. Den comes anudder werry <lb/>unanswerable objecsh'un, and dat is, dat'e brig owe bot'<lb/> 
Simon and I money. Fifty dollars, each on us, if she owe<lb/>  
one cent. Now, do you t'ink in cander, Jack, dat two<lb/>  
colour' gentle'em, like us, can t'row away our fortins like<lb/>  
two sons of a York merchant dat has inherited a hundred<lb/>  
t'ousand dollar tudder day?”</p>
            <p>“There is no occasion for running at all, or for losing<lb/>  
your wages.”</p>
            <p>“How you get'e mate off, den? Can he walk away on<lb/>  
de water? If so, let him go widout us. A werry good<lb/>  
gentle'em is Misser Mulford, but not good enough to mulk<lb/>  
Simon and me out of fifty dollar each.”</p>
            <p>“You will not hear my project, Josh, and so will never<lb/>  
know what I would be at.”</p>
            <p>“Well, come, tell him jest as you surposes him. Now<lb/>  
listen, Simon, so dat not a word be loss.”</p>
            <p>“My plan is to take the boat, if we anchor, as anchor<lb/>  
I know we shall, and go and find the rock and bring Mr.<lb/>  
Mulford off; then we can come back to the brig, and get<lb/>  
on board ourselves, and let the mate sail away in the boat<lb/>  
by himself. On this plan nobody will run, and no wages<lb/>  
be mulcted.”</p>
            <p>“But dat take time and an anchor-watch last but two<lb/>  
hour, surposin' even dat'ey puts all t'ree of us in de same<lb/>  
watch.”</p>
            <p>“Spike usually does that, you know. ‘Let the cook<lb/>  
and the stewards keep the midnight watch,’ he commonly<lb/>  
says, ‘and that will give the foremost hands a better snooze.’”</p>
            <p>“Yes, he do say <hi rend="italics">dat,</hi> Josh,” put in Simon, “most ebbery<lb/>  
time we comes-to.”</p>
            <p>“I know he does, and surposes he will say it to-night, if<lb/>
               <pb n="036"/>  
he comes-to to-night. But a two hour watch may not be<lb/>  
long enough to do all you wants; and den, jest t'ink for a<lb/>  
moment, should 'e cap'in come on deck and hail'e <lb/>forecastle, and find us all gone, I wouldn't be in your skin,<lb/>  
Jack, for dis brig, in sich a kerlamity. I knows Cap'in<lb/>  
Spike well; t'ree time I endebber to run myself, and each<lb/>  
time he bring me up wid a round turn; so, now-a-days, I<lb/>  
nebber t'inks of sich a projeck any longer.”</p>
            <p>“But I do not intend to leave the forecastle without<lb/>  
some one on it to answer a hail. No, all I want is a <lb/>companion; for I do not like to go out on the reef at midnight,<lb/>  
all alone. If one of you will go with me, the other can<lb/>  
stay and answer the captain's hail, should he really come<lb/>  
on deck in our watch—a thing very little likely to happen.<lb/>  
When once his head is on his pillow, a'ter a hard day's<lb/>  
work, it's not very apt to be lifted ag'in without a call, or<lb/>  
a squall. If you do know Stephen Spike <hi rend="italics">well,</hi> Josh, I know<lb/>  
him better.”</p>
            <p>“Well, Jack, dis here is a new idee, d'ye see, and a body<lb/>  
must take time to consider on it. If Simon and I do ship<lb/>  
for dis v'y'ge, 't will be for lub of Mr. Mulford, and not for<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">his</hi> money or <hi rend="italics">your'n”</hi>.</p>
            <p>This was all the encouragement of his project Jack Tier<lb/>  
could obtain, on that occasion, from either his brother<lb/>  
steward, or from the cook. These blacks were well enough<lb/>  
disposed to rescue an innocent and unoffending man from<lb/>  
the atrocious death to which Spike had condemned his<lb/>  
mate, but neither lost sight of his own security and interest.<lb/>  
They promised Tier not to betray him, however; and he<lb/>  
had the fullest confidence in their pledges. They who live<lb/>  
together in common, usually understand the feeling that<lb/>  
prevails, on any given point, in their own set; and Jack<lb/>  
felt pretty certain that Harry was a greater favourite in and<lb/>  
about the camboose than the captain. On that feeling he<lb/>  
relied, and he was fain to wait the course of events, ere he<lb/>  
came to any absolute conclusion as to his own course.</p>
            <p>The interview in the galley took place about half an<lb/>  
hour before the brig anchored for the night. Tier, who<lb/>  
often assisted on such occasions, went aloft to help secure<lb/>  
the royal, one of the gaskets of which had got loose, and<lb/>  
from the yard he had an excellent opportunity to take a<lb/>
               <pb n="037"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
look at the reef, the situation of the vessel, and the <lb/>probable bearings of the rock on which poor Mulford had been<lb/>  
devoted to a miserable death. This opportunity was much<lb/>  
increased by Spike's hailing him, while on the yard, and<lb/>  
ordering him to take a good look at the sloop-of-war, and<lb/>  
at the same time to ascertain if any boats were “prowlin'<lb/>  
about, in order to make a set upon us in the night.” On<lb/>  
receiving this welcome order, Jack answered with a <lb/>cheerful “Ay, ay, sir,” and standing up on the yard, he placed<lb/>  
an arm around the mast, and remained for a long time<lb/>  
making his observations. The command to look-out for<lb/>  
boats would have been a sufficient excuse had he continued<lb/>  
on the yard as long as it was light.</p>
            <p>Jack had no difficulty in finding the Poughkeepsie, which<lb/>  
was already through the passage, and no longer visible<lb/>  
from the deck. She appeared to be standing to the <lb/>northward and westward, under easy canvas, like a craft that<lb/>  
was in no hurry. This fact was communicated to Spike in<lb/>  
the usual way. The latter seemed pleased, and he answered<lb/>  
in a hearty manner, just as if no difficulty had ever occurred<lb/>  
between him and the steward's assistant.</p>
            <p>“Very well, Jack! bravo, Jack!—now take a good look<lb/>  
for boats; you'll have light enough for that this half hour,”<lb/>  
cried the captain. “If any are out, you'll find them <lb/>pulling down the channel, or maybe they'll try to shorten the<lb/>  
cut, by attempting to pull athwart the reef. Take a good<lb/>  
and steady look for them, my man.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, sir; I'll do all I can with naked eyes,” <lb/>answered Jack, “but I could do better, sir, if they would only<lb/>  
send me up a glass by these here signal-halyards. With a<lb/>  
glass, a fellow might speak with some sartainty.”</p>
            <p>Spike seemed struck with the truth of this suggestion;<lb/>  
and he soon sent a glass aloft by the signal-halyards. Thus<lb/>  
provided, Jack descended as low as the cross-trees, where<lb/>  
he took his seat, and began a survey at his leisure. While<lb/>  
thus employed, the brig was secured for the night, her<lb/>  
decks were cleared, and the people were ordered to get<lb/>  
their suppers, previously to setting an anchor-watch, and<lb/>  
turning-in for the night. No one heeded the movements<lb/>  
of Tier,—for Spike had gone into his own state-room,—<lb/>  
with the exception of Josh and Simon. Those two worthies<lb/>
               <pb n="038"/>  
were still in the galley, conversing on the subject of Jack's<lb/>  
recent communications; and ever and anon one of them<lb/>  
would stick his head out of the door and look aloft, <lb/>withdrawing it, and shaking it significantly, as soon as his <lb/>observations were ended.</p>
            <p>As for Tier, he was seated quite at his ease; and having<lb/>  
slung his glass to one of the shrouds, in a way to admit of<lb/>  
its being turned as on a pivot, he had every opportunity<lb/>  
for observing accurately, and at his leisure. The first<lb/>  
thing Jack did, was to examine the channel very closely,<lb/>  
in order to make sure that no boats were in it, after which<lb/>  
he turned the glass with great eagerness toward the reef,<lb/>  
in the almost hopeless office of ascertaining something <lb/>concerning Mulford. In point of fact, the brig had anchored<lb/>  
quite three leagues from the solitary rock of the deserted<lb/>  
mate, and, favoured as he was by his elevation, Jack could<lb/>  
hardly expect to discern so small and low an object as that<lb/>  
rock at so great a distance. Nevertheless, the glass was<lb/>  
much better than common. It had been a present to Spike<lb/>  
from one who was careful in his selections of such objects,<lb/>  
and who had accidentally been under a serious obligation<lb/>  
to the captain. Knowing the importance of a good look,<lb/>  
as regards the boats, Spike had brought this particular <lb/>instrument, of which, in common, he was very chary, from<lb/>  
his own state-room, and sent it aloft, in order that Jack<lb/>  
might have every available opportunity of ascertaining his<lb/>  
facts. It was this glass, then, which was the means of the<lb/>  
important discoveries the little fellow, who was thus perched<lb/>  
on the fore-topmast cross-trees of the Swash, did actually<lb/>  
succeed in making.</p>
            <p>Jack actually started, when he first ascertained how <lb/>distinctly and near the glass he was using brought distant<lb/>  
objects. The gulls that sailed across its disk, though a<lb/>  
league off, appeared as if near enough to be touched by the<lb/>  
hand, and even their feathers gave out not only their hues,<lb/>  
but their forms. Thus, too, was it with the surface of the<lb/>  
ocean, of which the little waves that agitated the water of<lb/>  
the reef, might be seen tossing up and down, at more than<lb/>  
twice the range of the Poughkeepsie's heaviest gun. Naked<lb/>  
rocks, low and subdued as they were in colour, too, were<lb/>  
to be noted, scattered up and down in the panorama. At<lb/>
               <pb n="039"/>  
length Tier fancied his glass covered a field that he <lb/>recognized. It was distant, but might be seen from his present<lb/>  
elevation. A second look satisfied him he was right; and<lb/>  
he next clearly traced the last channel in which they had<lb/>  
endeavoured to escape from Spike, or that in which the<lb/>  
boat had been taken. Following it along, by slowly moving<lb/>  
the glass, he actually hit the rock on which Mulford had<lb/>  
been deserted. It was peculiar in shape, size, and <lb/>elevation above the water, and connected with the circumstance<lb/>  
of the channel, which was easily enough seen by the colour<lb/>  
of the water, and more easily from his height than if he<lb/>  
had been in it, he could not be mistaken. The little <lb/>fellow's heart beat quick as he made the glass move slowly<lb/>  
over its surface, anxiously searching for the form of the<lb/>  
mate. It was not to be seen. A second, and a more <lb/>careful sweep of the glass, made it certain that the rock was<lb/>  
deserted.</p>
            <p>Although a little reflection might have satisfied any one<lb/>  
Mulford was not to be sought in that particular spot, so<lb/>  
long after he had been left there, Jack Tier felt grievously<lb/>  
disappointed when he was first made certain of the <lb/>accuracy of his observations. A minute later he began to <lb/>reason on the matter, and he felt more encouraged. The<lb/>  
rock on which the mate had been abandoned was smooth,<lb/>  
and could not hold any fresh water that might have been left<lb/>  
by the late showers. Jack also remembered that it had<lb/>  
neither sea-weed nor shell-fish. In short, the utmost malice<lb/>  
of Spike could not have selected, for the immolation of his<lb/>  
victim, a more suitable place. Now Tier had heard<lb/>  
Harry's explanation to Rose, touching the manner in which<lb/>  
he had waded and swum about the reef that very morning,<lb/>  
and it at once occurred to him that the young man had too<lb/>  
much energy and spirit to remain helpless and inactive to<lb/>  
perish on a naked rock, when there might be a possibility<lb/>  
of at least prolonging existence, if not of saving it. This<lb/>  
induced the steward to turn the glass slowly over the water,<lb/>  
and along all the ranges of visible rock that he could find<lb/>  
in that vicinity. For a long time the search was useless,<lb/>  
the distance rendering such an examination not only <lb/>difficult but painful. At length Jack, about to give up the<lb/>  
matter in despair, took one sweep with the glass nearer to<lb/>
               <pb n="040"/>  
the brig, as much to obtain a general idea of the <lb/>boat-channels of the reef, as in any hope of finding Mulford,<lb/>  
when an object moving in the water came within the field<lb/>  
of the glass. He saw it but for an instant, as the glass<lb/>  
swept slowly past, but it struck him it was something that<lb/>  
had life, and was in motion. Carefully going over the same<lb/>  
ground again, after a long search, he again found what he<lb/>  
so anxiously sought. A good look satisfied him that he<lb/>  
was right. It was certainly a man wading along the <lb/>shallow water of the reef, immersed to his waist—and it must<lb/>  
be Mulford.</p>
            <p>So excited was Jack Tier by this discovery that he <lb/>trembled like a leaf. A minute or two elapsed before he could<lb/>  
again use the glass; and when he did, a long and anxious<lb/>  
search was necessary before so small an object could be<lb/>  
once more found. Find it he did, however, and then he<lb/>  
got its range by the vessel, in a way to make sure of it.<lb/>  
Yes, it was a man, and it was Mulford.</p>
            <p>Circumstances conspired to aid Jack in the investigation<lb/>  
that succeeded. The sun was near setting, but a stream<lb/>  
of golden light gleamed over the waters, particularly <lb/>illuminating the portion which came within the field of the<lb/>  
glass. It appeared then that Harry, in his efforts to escape<lb/>  
from the rock, and to get nearer to the edge of the main<lb/>  
channel, where his chances of being seen and rescued<lb/>  
would be ten-fold what they were on his rock, had moved<lb/>  
south, by following the naked reef and the shallow places,<lb/>  
and was actually more than a league nearer to the brig than<lb/>  
he would have been had he remained stationary. There<lb/>  
had been hours in which to make this change, and the<lb/>  
young man had probably improved them to the utmost.</p>
            <p>Jack watched the form that was wading slowly along<lb/>  
with an interest he had never before felt in the movements<lb/>  
of any human being. Whether Mulford saw the brig or<lb/>  
not, it was difficult to say. She was quite two leagues<lb/>  
from him, and, now that her sails were furled, she offered<lb/>  
but little for the eye to rest on at that distance. At first,<lb/>  
Jack thought the young man was actually endeavouring to<lb/>  
get nearer to her, though it must have been a forlorn hope<lb/>  
that should again place him in the hands of Spike. It was,<lb/>  
however, a more probable conjecture that the young man<lb/>
               <pb n="041"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
was endeavouring to reach the margin of the passage,<lb/>  
where a good deal of rock was above water, and near to<lb/>  
which he had already managed to reach. At one time<lb/>  
Jack saw that the mate was obliged to swim, and he <lb/>actually lost sight of him for a time. His form, however, <lb/>reappeared, and then it slowly emerged from the water, and<lb/>  
stood erect on a bare rock of some extent. Jack breathed<lb/>  
freer at this; for Mulford was now on the very margin of<lb/>  
the channel, and might be easily reached by the boat, should<lb/>  
he prevail on Josh, or Simon, to attempt the rescue.</p>
            <p>At first, Jack Tier fancied that Mulford had knelt to <lb/>return thanks on his arrival at a place of comparative safety;<lb/>  
but a second look satisfied him that Harry was drinking<lb/>  
from one of the little pools of fresh water left by the late<lb/>  
shower. When he rose from drinking, the young man<lb/>  
walked about the place, occasionally stooping, signs that<lb/>  
he was picking up shell-fish for his supper. Suddenly,<lb/>  
Mulford darted forward, and passed beyond the field of the<lb/>  
glass. When Jack found him again, he was in the act of<lb/>  
turning a small turtle, using his knife on the animal <lb/>immediately after. Had Jack been in danger of starvation <lb/>himself, and found a source of food as ample and as grateful<lb/>  
as this, he could scarcely have been more delighted. The<lb/>  
light now began to wane perceptibly, still Harry's <lb/>movements could be discerned. The turtle was killed and<lb/>  
dressed, sufficiently at least for the mate's purposes, and<lb/>  
the latter was seen collecting sea-weed, and bits of plank,<lb/>  
boards, and sticks of wood, of which more or less, in <lb/>drifting past, had lodged upon the rocks. “Is it possible,”<lb/>  
thought Jack, “that he is so werry partic'lar he can't eat<lb/>  
his turtle raw! Will he, indeed, venture to light a fire, or<lb/>  
has he the means?” Mulford was so particular, however,<lb/>  
he did venture to light a fire, and he had the means. This<lb/>  
may be said to be the age of matches—not in a connubial,<lb/>  
though in an inflammatory sense—and the mate had a small<lb/>  
stock in a tight box that he habitually carried on his <lb/>person. Tier saw him at work over a little pile he had made<lb/>  
for a long time, the beams of day departing now so fast as<lb/>  
to make him fearful he should soon lose his object in the<lb/>  
increasing obscurity of twilight. Suddenly a light gleamed,<lb/>  
and the pile sent forth a clear flame. Mulford went to and<lb/>
               <pb n="042"/>  
fro, collecting materials to feed his fire, and was soon busied<lb/>  
in cooking his turtle. All this Tier saw and understood,<lb/>  
the light of the flames coming in proper time to supply the<lb/>  
vacuum left by the departure of that of day.</p>
            <p>In a minute Tier had no difficulty in seeing the fire that<lb/>  
Mulford had lighted on his low and insulated domains with<lb/>  
the naked eye. It gleamed brightly in that solitary place;<lb/>  
and the steward was much afraid it would be seen by some<lb/>  
one on deck, get to be reported to Spike, and lead to<lb/>  
Harry's destruction after all. The mate appeared to be<lb/>  
insensible to his danger, however, occasionally casting piles<lb/>  
of dry sea-weed on his fire, in a way to cause the flames<lb/>  
to flash up, as if kindled anew by gunpowder. It now <lb/>occurred to Tier that the young man had a double object in<lb/>  
lighting this fire, which would answer not only the purposes<lb/>  
of his cookery, but as a signal of distress to anything <lb/>passing near. The sloop-of-war, though more distant than the<lb/>  
brig, was in his neighbourhood; and she might possibly<lb/>  
yet send relief. Such was the state of things when Jack<lb/>  
was startled by a sudden hail from below. It was Spike's<lb/>  
voice, and came up to him short and quick.</p>
            <p>“Fore-topmast cross-trees, there! What are ye about<lb/>  
all this time, Master Jack Tier, in them fore-topmast <lb/>cross-trees, I say?” demanded Spike.</p>
            <p>“Keeping a look-out for boats from the sloop-of-war, as<lb/>  
you bade me, sir,” answered Jack, coolly.</p>
            <p>“D'ye see any, my man? Is the water clear ahead of<lb/>  
us, or not?”</p>
            <p>“It's getting to be so dark, sir, I can see no longer.<lb/>  
While there was day-light, no boat was to be seen.”</p>
            <p>“Come down, man—come down; I've business for you<lb/>  
below. The sloop is far enough to the nor'ard, and we<lb/>  
shall neither see nor hear from her to-night. Come down,<lb/>  
I say, Jack—come down.”</p>
            <p>Jack obeyed, and securing the glass, he began to descend<lb/>  
the rigging. He was soon as low as the top, when he<lb/>  
paused a moment to take another look. The fire was still<lb/>  
visible, shining like a torch on the surface of the water,<lb/>  
casting its beams abroad like “a good deed in a naughty<lb/>  
world.” Jack was sorry to see it, though he once more<lb/>  
took its bearing from the brig, in order that he might know<lb/>
               <pb n="043"/>  
where to find the spot, in the event of a search for it. When<lb/>  
on the stretcher of the fore-rigging, Jack stopped and again<lb/>  
looked for his beacon. It had disappeared, having sunk<lb/>  
below the circular formation of the earth. By ascending<lb/>  
two or three ratlins, it came into view, and by going down<lb/>  
as low as the stretcher again, it disappeared. Trusting<lb/>  
that no one, at that hour, would have occasion to go aloft,<lb/>  
Jack now descended to the deck, and went aft with the<lb/>  
spy-glass.</p>
            <p>Spike and the Señor Montefalderon were under the<lb/>  
coach-house, no one else appearing on any part of the <lb/>quarter-deck. The people were eating their suppers, and Josh<lb/>  
and Simon were busy in the galley. As for the females,<lb/>  
they chose to remain in their own cabin, where Spike was<lb/>  
well pleased to leave them.</p>
            <p>“Come this way, Jack,” said the captain, in his <lb/>best-humoured tone of voice, “I've a word to say to you. Put<lb/>  
the glass in at my state-room window, and come hither.”</p>
            <p>Tier did as ordered.</p>
            <p>“So you can make out no boats to the nor'ard, ha, Jack!<lb/>  
nothing to be seen thereaway?”</p>
            <p>“Nothing in the way of a boat, sir.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, I dare say there's plenty of water, and some<lb/>  
rock. The Florida Reef has no scarcity of either, to them<lb/>  
that knows where to look for one, and to steer clear of the<lb/>  
other. Hark'e, Jack; so you got the schooner under way<lb/>  
from the Dry Tortugas, and undertook to beat her up to<lb/>  
Key West, when she fancied herself a turtle, and over she<lb/>  
went with you—is that it, my man?”</p>
            <p>“The schooner turned turtle with us, sure enough, sir;<lb/>  
and we all came near drowning on her bottom.”</p>
            <p>“No sharks in that latitude and longitude, eh Jack?”</p>
            <p>“Plenty on 'em, sir; and I thought they would have got<lb/>  
us all, at one time. More than twenty set of fins were in<lb/>  
sight at once, for several hours.”</p>
            <p>“You could hardly have supplied the gentlemen with a<lb/>  
leg, or an arm, each. But where was the boat all this time<lb/>  
—you had the light-house boat in tow, I suppose?”</p>
            <p>“She had been in tow, sir; but Madam Budd talked so<lb/>  
much dictionary to the painter, that it got adrift.”</p>
            <p>“Yet I found you all in it.”</p>
            <pb n="044"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“Very true, sir. Mr. Mulford swam quite a mile to<lb/>  
reach the rocks, and found the boat aground on one on 'em.<lb/>  
As soon as he got the boat, he made sail, and came and<lb/>  
took us off. We had reason to thank God he could do<lb/>  
so.”</p>
            <p>Spike looked dark and thoughtful. He muttered the<lb/>  
words “swam,” and “rocks,” but was too cautious to <lb/>allow any expressions to escape him, that might betray to the<lb/>  
Mexican officer that which was uppermost in his mind.<lb/>  
He was silent, however, for quite a minute, and Jack saw<lb/>  
that he had awakened a dangerous source of distrust in the<lb/>  
captain's breast.</p>
            <p>“Well, Jack,” resumed Spike, after the pause, “can<lb/>  
you tell us anything of the doubloons? I nat'rally expected<lb/>  
to find them in the boat, but there were none to be seen.<lb/>  
You scarcely pumped the schooner out, without <lb/>overhauling her lockers, and falling in with them doubloons.”</p>
            <p>“We found them, sure enough, and had them ashore<lb/>  
with us, in the tent, down to the moment when we sailed.”</p>
            <p>“When you took them off to the schooner, eh? My life<lb/>  
for it, the gold was not forgotten.”</p>
            <p>“It was not, sure enough, sir; but we took it off with<lb/>  
us to the schooner, and it went down in her when she<lb/>  
finally sunk.”</p>
            <p>Another pause, during which Señor Montefalderon and<lb/>  
Captain Spike looked significantly at each other.</p>
            <p>“Do you think, Jack, you could find the spot where the<lb/>  
schooner went down?”</p>
            <p>“I could come pretty near it, sir, though not on the very<lb/>  
spot itself. Water leaves no mark over the grave of a<lb/>  
sunken ship.”</p>
            <p>“If you can take us within a reasonable distance, we<lb/>  
might find it by sweeping for it. Them doubloons are<lb/>  
worth some trouble; and their recovery would be better<lb/>  
than a long v'y'ge to us, any day.”</p>
            <p>“They would, indeed, Don Esteban,” observed the <lb/>Mexican; “and my poor country is not in a condition to bear<lb/>  
heavy losses. If Señor Jack Tier can find the wreck, and<lb/>  
we regain the money, ten of those doubloons shall be his<lb/>  
reward, though I take them from my own share, much <lb/>diminished as it will be.”</p>
            <pb n="045"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“You hear, Jack—here is a chance to make your <lb/>fortune! You say you sailed with me in old times—and old<lb/>  
times were good times with this brig, though times has<lb/>  
changed; but if you sailed with me, in <hi rend="italics">old</hi> times, you must<lb/>  
remember that whatever the Swash touched she turned to<lb/>  
gold.”</p>
            <p>“I hope you do n't doubt, Captain Spike, my having<lb/>  
sailed in the brig, not only in old times, but in her best<lb/>  
times.”</p>
            <p>Jack seemed hurt as he put this question, and Spike <lb/>appeared in doubt. The latter gazed at the little, rotund,<lb/>  
queer-looking figure before him, as if endeavouring to <lb/>recognise him; and when he had done, he passed his hand<lb/>  
over his brow, like one who endeavoured to recall past <lb/>objects by excluding those that are present.</p>
            <p>“You will then show us the spot where my unfortunate<lb/>  
schooner did sink, Señor Jack Tier?” put in the Mexican.</p>
            <p>“With all my heart, señor, if it is to be found. I think<lb/>  
I could take you within a cable's length of the place, though<lb/>  
hunger, and thirst, and sharks, and the fear of drowning,<lb/>  
will keep a fellow from having a very bright look-out for<lb/>  
such a matter.”</p>
            <p>“In what water do you suppose the craft to lie, Jack?”<lb/>  
demanded the captain.</p>
            <p>“You know as much of that as I do myself, sir. She<lb/>  
went down about a cable's length from the reef, toward<lb/>  
which she was a settin' at the time; and had she kept afloat<lb/>  
an hour longer, she might have grounded on the rocks.”</p>
            <p>“She 's better where she is, if we can only find her by<lb/>  
sweeping. On the rocks we could do nothing with her but<lb/>  
break her up, and ten to one the doubloons would be lost.<lb/>  
By the way, Jack, do you happen to know where that<lb/>  
scoundrel of a mate of mine stowed the money?”</p>
            <p>“When we left the island, I carried it down to the boat<lb/>  
myself—and a good lift I had of it. As sure as you are<lb/>  
there, señor, I was obliged to take it on a shoulder. When<lb/>  
it came out of the boat, Mr. Mulford carried it below; and<lb/>  
I heard him tell Miss Rose, a'terwards that he had thrown<lb/>  
it into a bread-locker.”</p>
            <p>“Where we shall find it, Don Wan, notwithstanding all<lb/>  
this veering and hauling. The old brig has luck when,<lb/>
               <pb n="046"/>  
doubloons are in question, and ever has had since I've<lb/>  
commanded her. Jack, we shall have to call on the cook<lb/>  
and stewards for an anchor-watch to-night. The people<lb/>  
are a good deal fagged with boxing about this reef so much,<lb/>  
and I shall want 'em all as fresh to-morrow as they can be<lb/>  
got. You idlers had better take the middle watches, which<lb/>  
will give the fore-castle chaps longer naps.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, sir; we'll manage that for 'em. Josh and <lb/>Simon can go on at twelve, and I will take the watch at two,<lb/>  
which will give the men all the rest they want, as I can<lb/>  
hold out for four hours full. I'm as good for an <lb/>anchor-watch as any man in the brig, Captain Spike.”</p>
            <p>“That you are, Jack, and better than some on 'em.<lb/>  
Take you all round, and round it is, you 're a rum 'un, my<lb/>  
lad—the queerest little jigger that ever lay out on a <lb/>royal-yard.”</p>
            <p>Jack might have been a little offended at Spike's <lb/>compliments, but he was certainly not sorry to find him so <lb/>good-natured, after all that had passed. He now left the captain,<lb/>  
and his Mexican companion, seemingly in close conference<lb/>  
together, while he went below himself, and dropped as<lb/>  
naturally into the routine of his duty, as if he had never<lb/>  
left the brig. In the cabin he found the females, of course.<lb/>  
Rose scarce raising her face from the shawl which lay on<lb/>  
the bed of her own berth. Jack busied himself in a locker<lb/>  
near this berth, until an opportunity occurred to touch<lb/>  
Rose, unseen by her aunt or Biddy. The poor <lb/>heart-stricken girl raised her face, from which all the colour<lb/>  
had departed, and looked almost vacantly at Jack, as if to<lb/>  
ask an explanation. Hope is truly, by a most benevolent<lb/>  
provision of Providence, one of the very last blessings to<lb/>  
abandon us. It is probable that we are thus gifted, in order<lb/>  
to encourage us to rely on the great atonement to the last<lb/>  
moment, since, without this natural endowment to cling to<lb/>  
hope, despair might well be the fate of millions, who, there<lb/>  
is reason to think, reap the benefit of that act of divine<lb/>  
mercy. It would hardly do to say that anything like hope<lb/>  
was blended with the look Rose now cast on Jack, but it<lb/>  
was anxious and inquiring.</p>
            <p>The steward bent his head to the locker, bringing his<lb/>  
face quite near to that of Rose, and whispered—“There<lb/>  
is hope, Miss Rose—but do not betray me.”</p>
            <pb n="047"/>
            <p/>
            <p>These were blessed words for our heroine to hear, and<lb/>  
they produced an immediate and great revolution in her<lb/>  
feelings. Commanding herself, however, she looked her<lb/>  
questions, instead of trusting even to a whisper. Jack did<lb/>  
not say any more, just then; but, shortly after, he called<lb/>  
Rose, whose eyes were now never off him, into the main<lb/>  
cabin, which was empty. It was so much pleasanter to<lb/>  
sleep in an airy state-room on deck, that Señor <lb/>Montefalderon, indeed, had given up the use of this cabin, in a<lb/>  
great measure, seldom appearing in it, except at meals,<lb/>  
having taken possession of the deserted apartment of <lb/>Mulford. Josh was in the galley, where he spent most of his<lb/>  
time, and Rose and Jack had no one to disturb their <lb/>conference.</p>
            <p>“He is safe, Miss Rose—God be praised!” whispered<lb/>  
Jack. “Safe for the present, at least; with food, and<lb/>  
water, and fire to keep him warm at night.”</p>
            <p>It was impossible for Rose not to understand to whom<lb/>  
there was allusion, though her head became dizzy under<lb/>  
the painful confusion that prevailed in it. She pressed her<lb/>  
temples with both hands, and asked a thousand questions<lb/>  
with her eyes. Jack considerately handed her a glass of<lb/>  
water before he proceeded. As soon as he found her a<lb/>  
little more composed, he related the facts connected with<lb/>  
his discovery of Mulford, precisely as they had occurred.</p>
            <p>“He is now on a large rock—a little island, indeed—<lb/>  
where he is safe from the ocean unless it comes on to blow<lb/>  
a hurricane,” concluded Jack, “has fresh water and fresh<lb/>  
turtle in the bargain. A man might live a month on one<lb/>  
such turtle as I saw Mr. Mulford cutting up this evening.”</p>
            <p>“Is there no way of rescuing him from the situation<lb/>  
you have mentioned, Jack? In a year or two I shall be<lb/>  
my own mistress, and have money to do as I please with;<lb/>  
put me only in the way of taking Mr. Mulford from that<lb/>  
rock, and I will share all I am worth on earth with you,<lb/>  
dear Jack.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, so it is with the whole sex,” muttered Tier; “let<lb/>  
them only once give up their affections to a man, and he<lb/>  
becomes dearer to them than pearls and rubies! But you<lb/>  
know me, Miss Rose, and know <hi rend="italics">why</hi> and <hi rend="italics">how well</hi> I would<lb/>  
sarve you. My story and my feelin's are as much your<lb/>
               <pb n="048"/>  
secret, as your story and your feelin's is mine. We shall<lb/>  
pull together, if we do n't pull so very strong. Now, hearken<lb/>  
to me, Miss Rose, and I will let you into the secret of my<lb/>  
plan to help Mr. Mulford make a launch.”</p>
            <p>Jack then communicated to his companion his whole<lb/>  
project for the night. Spike had, of his own accord, given<lb/>  
to him and his two associates, Simon and Josh, the care<lb/>  
of the brig between midnight and morning. If he could<lb/>  
prevail on either of these men to accompany him, it was<lb/>  
his intention to take the light-house boat, which was riding<lb/>  
by its painter astern of the brig, and proceed as fast as<lb/>  
they could to the spot whither Mulford had found his way.<lb/>  
By his calculations, if the wind stood as it then was, little<lb/>  
more than an hour would be necessary to reach the rock,<lb/>  
and about as much more to return. Should the breeze<lb/>  
lull, of which there was no great danger, since the easterly<lb/>  
trades were again blowing, Jack thought he and Josh might<lb/>  
go over the distance with the oars in about double the time.<lb/>  
Should both Josh and Simon refuse to accompany him, he<lb/>  
thought he should attempt the rescue of the mate alone,<lb/>  
did the wind stand, trusting to Mulford's assistance, should<lb/>  
he need it, in getting back to the brig.</p>
            <p>“You surely would not come back here with Harry,<lb/>  
did you once get him safe from off that rock!” exclaimed<lb/>  
Rose.</p>
            <p>“Why, you know how it is with me, Miss Rose,” <lb/>answered Jack. “<hi rend="italics">My</hi> business is here, on board the Swash,<lb/>  
and I must attend to it. Nothing shall tempt me to give<lb/>  
up the brig so long as she floats, and sartain folk float in<lb/>  
her, unless it might be some such matter as that which<lb/>  
happened on the bit of an island at the Dry Tortugas. Ah!<lb/>  
he's a willian! But if I do come back, it will be only to<lb/>  
get into my own proper berth ag'in, and not to bring Mr.<lb/>  
Mulford into the lion's jaws. He will only have to put me<lb/>  
back on board the Molly here, when he can make the best<lb/>  
of his own way to Key West. Half an hour would place<lb/>  
him out of harm's way; especially as I happen to know<lb/>  
the course Spike means to steer in the morning.”</p>
            <p>“I will go with you, Jack,” said Rose, mildly, but with<lb/>  
great firmness.</p>
            <p>“You, Miss Rose! But why should I show surprise!<lb/>
               <pb n="049"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
It's like all the sex, when they have given away their<lb/>  
affections. Yes, woman will be woman, put her on a naked<lb/>  
rock, or put her in silks and satins in her parlour at home.<lb/>  
How different is it with men! They dote for a little while,<lb/>  
and turn to a new face. It must be said, men's willians!”</p>
            <p>“Not Mulford, Jack—no, not Harry Mulford! A truer<lb/>  
or a nobler heart never beat in a human breast; and you<lb/>  
and I will drown together, rather than he should not be<lb/>  
taken from that rock.”</p>
            <p>“It shall be as you say,” answered Jack, a little <lb/>thoughtfully. “Perhaps it would be best that you should quit the<lb/>  
brig altogether. Spike is getting desperate, and you will<lb/>  
be safer with the young mate than with so great an old<lb/>  
willian. Yes, you shall go with me, Miss Rose; and if<lb/>  
Josh and Simon both refuse, we will go alone.”</p>
            <p>“With you, Jack, but not with Mr. Mulford. I cannot<lb/>  
desert my aunt, nor can I quit the Swash alone in company<lb/>  
with her mate. As for Spike, I despise him too much to<lb/>  
fear him. He must soon go into port somewhere, and at<lb/>  
the first place where he touches we shall quit him. He<lb/>  
dare not detain us—nay, he <hi rend="italics">cannot</hi>—and I do not fear him.<lb/>  
We will save Harry, but I shall remain with my aunt.”</p>
            <p>“We'll see, Miss Rose, we'll see,” said Tier, smiling.<lb/>  
“Perhaps a handsome young man, like Mr. Mulford, will<lb/>  
have better luck in persuading you than an old fellow like<lb/>  
me. If he should fail, 't will be his own fault.”</p>
            <p>So thought Jack Tier, judging of women as he had found<lb/>  
them, but so did not think Rose Budd. The conversation<lb/>  
ended here, however, each keeping in view its purport,<lb/>  
and the serious business that was before them.</p>
            <p>The duty of the vessel went on as usual. The night<lb/>  
promised to be clouded, but not very dark, as there was a<lb/>  
moon. When Spike ordered the anchor-watches, he had<lb/>  
great care to spare his crew as much as possible, for the<lb/>  
next day was likely to be one of great toil to them. He<lb/>  
intended to get the schooner up again, if possible; and<lb/>  
though he might not actually pump her out so as to cause<lb/>  
her to float, enough water was to be removed to enable<lb/>  
him to get at the doubloons. The situation of the <lb/>bread-locker was known, and as soon as the cabin was sufficiently<lb/>  
freed from water to enable one to move about in it, Spike<lb/>
               <pb n="050"/>  
did not doubt his being able to get at the gold. With his<lb/>  
resources and ingenuity, the matter in his own mind was<lb/>  
reduced to one of toil and time. Eight-and-forty hours,<lb/>  
and some hard labour, he doubted not would effect all he<lb/>  
cared for.</p>
            <p>In setting the anchor-watches for the night, therefore,<lb/>  
Stephen Spike bethought him as much of the morrow as<lb/>  
of the present moment. Don Juan offered to remain on<lb/>  
deck until midnight, and as he was as capable of giving an<lb/>  
alarm as any one else, the offer was accepted. Josh and<lb/>  
Simon were to succeed the Mexican, and to hold the <lb/>lookout for two hours, when Jack was to relieve them, and to<lb/>  
continue on deck until light returned, when he was to give<lb/>  
the captain a call. This arrangement made, Tier turned<lb/>  
in at once, desiring the cook to call him half an hour<lb/>  
before the proper period of his watch commenced. That<lb/>  
half hour Jack intended to employ in exercising his <lb/>eloquence in endeavouring to persuade either Josh or Simon<lb/>  
to be of his party. By eight o'clock the vessel lay in a<lb/>  
profound quiet, Señor Montefalderon pacing the <lb/>quarter-deck alone, while the deep breathing of Spike was to be<lb/>  
heard issuing through the open window of his state-room;<lb/>  
a window which it may be well to say to the uninitiated,<lb/>  
opened in-board, or toward the deck, and not outboard, or<lb/>  
toward the sea.</p>
            <p>For four solitary hours did the Mexican pace the deck<lb/>  
of the stranger, resting himself for a few minutes at a time<lb/>  
only, when wearied with walking. Does the reader fancy<lb/>  
that a man so situated had not plenty of occupation for his<lb/>  
thoughts? Don Juan Montefalderon was a soldier and a<lb/>  
gallant cavalier; and love of country had alone induced<lb/>  
him to engage in his present duties. Not that patriotism<lb/>  
which looks to political preferment through a popularity<lb/>  
purchased by the valgar acclamation which attends success<lb/>  
in arms, even when undeserved, or that patriotism which<lb/>  
induces men of fallen characters to endeavour to retrieve<lb/>  
former offences by the shortest and most reckless mode, or<lb/>  
that patriotism which shouts “our country right or wrong,”<lb/>  
regardless alike of God and his eternal laws, that are never<lb/>  
to be forgotten with impunity; but the patriotism which<lb/>  
would defend his home and fire-side, his altars and the<lb/>
               <pb n="051"/>  
graves of his fathers, from the ruthless steps of the invader.<lb/>  
We shall not pretend to say how far this gentleman entered<lb/>  
into the merits of the quarrel between the two republics,<lb/>  
which no arts of European jealousy can ever conceal from<lb/>  
the judgment of truth, for, with him, matters had gone<lb/>  
beyond the point when men feel the necessity of reasoning,<lb/>  
and when, perhaps, if such a condition of the mind is ever<lb/>  
to be defended, he found his perfect justification in feeling.<lb/>  
He had travelled, and knew life by observation, and not<lb/>  
through traditions and books. He had never believed,<lb/>  
therefore, that his countrymen could march to Washington,<lb/>  
or even to the Sabine; but he had hoped for better things<lb/>  
than had since occurred. The warlike qualities of the<lb/>  
Americans of the North, as he was accustomed to call<lb/>  
those who term themselves, <hi rend="italics">par excellence,</hi> Americans, a<lb/>  
name they are fated to retain, and to raise high on the scale<lb/>  
of national power and national pre-eminence, unless they<lb/>  
fall by their own hands, had taken him by surprise, as<lb/>  
they have taken all but those who knew the country well,<lb/>  
and who understood its people. Little had he imagined<lb/>  
that the small, widely-spread body of regulars, that figured<lb/>  
in the blue books, almanacs and army-registers of America,<lb/>  
as some six or seven thousand men, scattered along frontiers<lb/>  
of a thousand leagues in extent, could, at the beck of the<lb/>  
government, swell into legions of invaders, men able to<lb/>  
carry war to the capitals of his own states, thousands of<lb/>  
miles from their doors, and formidable alike for their energy,<lb/>  
their bravery, their readiness in the use of arms, and their<lb/>  
numbers. He saw what is perhaps justly called the boasting<lb/>  
of the American character, vindicated by their exploits;<lb/>  
and marches, conquests and victories that, if sober truth<lb/>  
were alone to cover the pages of history, would far outdo<lb/>  
in real labour and danger the boasted passage of the Alps<lb/>  
under Napoleon, and the exploits that succeeded it.</p>
            <p>Don Juan Montefalderon was a grave and thoughtful<lb/>  
man, of pure Iberian blood. He might have had about<lb/>  
him a little of the exaltation of the Spanish character; the<lb/>  
overflowings of a generous chivalry at the bottom; and,<lb/>  
under its influence, he may have set too high an estimate<lb/>  
on Mexico and her sons, but he was not one to shut his<lb/>  
eyes to the truth. He saw plainly that the northern <lb/>
               <pb n="052"/>neighbours of his country were a race formidable and enterprising,<lb/>  
and that of all the calumnies that had been heaped upon<lb/>  
them by rivalries and European superciliousness, that of<lb/>  
their not being military by temperament was, perhaps, the<lb/>  
most absurd of all. On the contrary, he had himself, though<lb/>  
anticipating evil, been astounded by the suddenness and<lb/>  
magnitude of their conquests, which in a few short months<lb/>  
after the breaking out of hostilities, had overrun regions<lb/>  
larger in extent than many ancient empires. All this had<lb/>  
been done, too, not by disorderly and barbarous hordes,<lb/>  
seeking in other lands the abundance that was wanting<lb/>  
at home; but with system and regularity, by men who<lb/>  
had turned the ploughshare into the sword for the <lb/>occasion, quitting abundance to encounter fatigue, famine,<lb/>  
and danger. In a word, the Señor Montefalderon saw<lb/>  
all the evils that environed his own land, and foresaw<lb/>  
others, of a still graver character that menaced the future.<lb/>  
On matters such as these did he brood in his walk, and<lb/>  
bitter did he find the minutes of that sad and lonely watch.<lb/>  
Although a Mexican, he could feel; although an avowed<lb/>  
foe of this good republic of ours, he had his principles, his<lb/>  
affections, and his sense of right. Whatever may be the<lb/>  
merits of the quarrel, and we are not disposed to deny that<lb/>  
our provocation has been great, a sense of right should<lb/>  
teach every man that what may be patriotic in an American,<lb/>  
would not be exactly the same thing in a Mexican, and<lb/>  
that we ought to respect in others sentiments that are so<lb/>  
much vaunted among ourselves. Midnight at length arrived,<lb/>  
and, calling the cook and steward, the unhappy gentleman<lb/>  
was relieved, and went to his berth to dream, in sorrow,<lb/>  
over the same pictures of national misfortunes, on which,<lb/>  
while waking, he had brooded in such deep melancholy.</p>
            <p>The watch of Josh and Simon was tranquil, meeting<lb/>  
with no interruption until it was time to summon Jack.<lb/>  
One thing these men had done, however, that was of some<lb/>  
moment to Tier, under a pledge given by Josh, and which<lb/>  
had been taken in return for a dollar in hand. They had<lb/>  
managed to haul the light-house boat alongside, from its<lb/>  
position astern, and this so noiselessly as not to give the<lb/>  
alarm to any one. There it lay, when Jack appeared,<lb/>  
ready at the main-rigging, to receive him at any moment<lb/>  
he might choose to enter it.</p>
            <pb n="053"/>
            <p/>
            <milestone unit="collation"/>
            <p>A few minutes after Jack appeared on deck, Rose and<lb/>  
Biddy came stealthily out of the cabin, the latter carrying<lb/>  
a basket filled with bread and broken meat, and not wanting<lb/>  
in sundry little delicacies, such as woman's hands prepare,<lb/>  
and, in this instance, woman's tenderness had provided.<lb/>  
The whole party met at the galley, a place so far removed<lb/>  
from the state-rooms aft as to be out of ear-shot. Here<lb/>  
Jack renewed his endeavours to persuade either Josh or<lb/>  
Simon to go in the boat, but without success. The negroes<lb/>  
had talked the matter over in their watch, and had come<lb/>  
to the conclusion the enterprise was too hazardous.</p>
            <p>“I tell you, Jack, you does n't know Cap'in Spike as well<lb/>  
as I does,” Josh said, in continuance of the discourse. “No,<lb/>  
you does n't know him at all as well as I does. If he finds<lb/>  
out that anybody has quit dis brig dis werry night, woful<lb/>  
will come! It no good to try to run; I run t'ree time, an'<lb/> 
Simon here run twice. What good it all do? We got<lb/>  
cotched, and here we is, just as fast as ever. I knows<lb/>  
Cap'in Spike, and does n't want to fall in athwart his hawse<lb/>  
any more.”</p>
            <p>“Y-e-s, dat my judgment too,” put in the cook. “We<lb/>  
wishes you well, Jack, and we wishes Miss Rose well, and<lb/>  
Mr. Mulford well, but we can't, no how, run ath'art hawse,<lb/>  
as Josh says. Dat is my judgment, too.”</p>
            <p>“Well, if your minds are made up to this, my darkies,<lb/>  
I s'pose there'll be no changing them,” said Jack. “At<lb/>  
all ewents you'll lend us a hand, by answering any hail<lb/>  
that may come from aft, in my watch, and in keepin' our<lb/>  
secret. There's another thing you can do for us, which<lb/>  
may be of service. Should Captain Spike miss the boat,<lb/>  
and lay any trap to catch us, you can just light this here<lb/>  
bit of lantern and hang it over the brig's bows, where he'll<lb/>  
not be likely to see it, that we may know matters are going<lb/>  
wrong, and give the craft a wide berth.”</p>
            <p>“Sartain,” said Josh, who entered heartily into the affair,<lb/>  
so far as good wishes for its success were concerned, at<lb/>  
the very moment when he had a most salutary care of his<lb/>  
own back. “Sartain; we do all dat, and no t'ank asked.<lb/>  
It no great matter to answer a hail, or to light a lantern<lb/>  
and sling him over de bows; and if Captain Spike want to<lb/>  
know who did it, let him find out.”</p>
            <pb n="054"/>
            <p/>
            <p>Here both negroes laughed heartily, manifesting so little<lb/>  
care to suppress their mirth, that Rose trembled lest their<lb/>  
noise should awaken Spike. Accustomed sounds, however,<lb/>  
seldom produce this effect on the ears of the sleeper, and<lb/>  
the heavy breathing from the state-room, succeeded the<lb/>  
merriment of the blacks, as soon as the latter ceased.<lb/>  
Jack now announced his readiness to depart. Some little<lb/>  
care and management were necessary to get into the boat<lb/>  
noiselessly, more especially with Biddy. It was done <lb/>however, with the assistance of the blacks, who cast off the<lb/>  
painter, when Jack gave the boat a shove to clear the brig,<lb/>  
and suffered it to drift astern for a considerable distance<lb/>  
before he ventured to cast loose the sail.</p>
            <p>“I know Spike well,” said Jack, in answer to a <lb/>remonstrance from the impatient Rose concerning his delay: “A<lb/>  
single flap of that canvas would wake him up, with the<lb/>  
brig anchored, while he would sleep through a salute of<lb/>  
heavy guns if it came in regular course. Quick ears has<lb/>  
old Stephen, and it's best to humour them. In a minute<lb/>  
more we'll set our canvas and be off.”</p>
            <p>All was done as Jack desired, and the boat got away<lb/>  
from the brig unheard and undetected. It was blowing a<lb/>  
good breeze, and Jack Tier had no sooner got the sail on<lb/>  
the boat, than away it started at a speed that would have<lb/>  
soon distanced Spike in his yawl, and with his best oarsmen.<lb/>  
The main point was to keep the course, though the <lb/>direction of the wind was a great assistant. By keeping the<lb/>  
wind abeam, Jack thought he should be going toward the<lb/>  
rock of Mulford. In one hour, or even in less time, he<lb/>  
expected to reach it, and he was guided by time, in his<lb/>  
calculations, as much as by any other criterion. Previously<lb/>  
to quitting the brig, he had gone up a few ratlins of the<lb/>  
fore-rigging to take the bearings of the fire on Mulford's<lb/>  
rock, but the light was no longer visible. As no star was<lb/>  
to be seen, the course was a little vague, but Jack was<lb/>  
navigator enough to understand that by keeping on the<lb/>  
weather side of the channel he was in the right road, and<lb/>  
that his great danger of missing his object was in <lb/>overrunning it.</p>
            <p>So much of the reef was above water, that it was not<lb/>  
difficult to steer a boat along its margin. The darkness,<lb/>
               <pb n="055"/>  
to be sure, rendered it a little uncertain how near they<lb/>  
were running to the rocks, but, on the whole, Jack assured<lb/>  
Rose he had no great difficulty in getting along.</p>
            <p>“These trades are almost as good as compasses,” he<lb/>  
said, “and the rocks are better, if we can keep close aboard<lb/>  
them without going on to them. I do not know the exact<lb/>  
distance of the spot we seek from the brig, but I judged it<lb/>  
to be about two leagues, as I looked at it from aloft. Now,<lb/>  
this boat will travel them two leagues in an hour, with<lb/>  
this breeze and in smooth water.”</p>
            <p>“I wish you had seen the fire again before we left the<lb/>  
brig,” said Rose, too anxious for the result not to feel<lb/>  
uneasiness on some account or other.</p>
            <p>“The mate is asleep, and the fire has burned down;<lb/>  
that's the explanation. Besides, fuel is not too plenty on<lb/>  
a place like that Mr. Mulford inhabits just now. As we<lb/>  
get near the spot, I shall look out for embers, which may<lb/>  
sarve as a light-house, or beacon, to guide us into port.”</p>
            <p>“Mr. Mulford will be charmed to see us, now that we<lb/>  
take him wather!” exclaimed Biddy. “Wather is a blessed<lb/>  
thing, and it's hard will be the heart that does not fale<lb/>  
gratitude for a planty of swate wather.”</p>
            <p>“The maty has plenty of food and water where he is,”<lb/>  
said Jack. “I'll answer for both them sarcumstances. I<lb/>  
saw him turn a turtle as plain as if I had been at his elbow,<lb/>  
and I saw him drinking at a hole in the rock, as heartily<lb/>  
as a boy ever pulled at a gimblet-hole in a molasses <lb/>hogs-head.”</p>
            <p>“But the distance was so great, Jack, I should hardly<lb/>  
think you could have distinguished objects so small.”</p>
            <p>“I went by the motions altogether. I saw the man, and<lb/>  
I saw the movements, and I knowed what the last meant.<lb/>  
It's true I couldn't swear to the turtle, though I saw <lb/>something on the rock that I knowed, by the way in which it<lb/>  
was handled, <hi rend="italics">must</hi> be a turtle. Then I saw the mate kneel,<lb/>  
and put his head low, and then I knowed he was drinking.”</p>
            <p>“Perhaps he prayed,” said Rose, solemnly.</p>
            <p>“Not he. Sailors isn't so apt to pray, Miss Rose; not<lb/>  
as apt as they ought to be. Women for prayers, and men<lb/>  
for work. Mr. Mulford is no worse than many others, but<lb/>  
I doubt if he be much given to <hi rend="italics">that</hi>.”</p>
            <pb n="056"/>
            <p/>
            <p>To this Rose made no answer, but Biddy took the matter<lb/>  
up, and, as the boat went briskly ahead, she pursued the<lb/>  
subject.</p>
            <p>“Then more is the shame for him,” said the Irish woman,<lb/>  
“and Miss Rose, and missus, and even I prayin' <hi rend="italics">for</hi> him,<lb/>  
all as if he was our own brudder. It's seldom I ask <lb/>anything for a heretic, but I could not forget a fine young man<lb/>  
like Mr. Mulford, and Miss Rose so partial to him, and he<lb/>  
in so bad a way. He ought to be ashamed to make his<lb/>  
brags that he is too proud to pray.”</p>
            <p>“Harry has made no such wicked boast,” put in Rose,<lb/>  
mildly; “nor do we know that he has not prayed for us,<lb/>  
as well as for himself. It may all be a mistake of Jack's,<lb/>  
you know.”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” added Jack, coolly, “it <hi rend="italics">may</hi> be a mistake, a'ter<lb/>  
all, for I was lookin' at the maty six miles off, and through<lb/>  
a spy-glass. No one can be sure of anything at such a<lb/>  
distance. So overlook the matter, my good Biddy, and<lb/>  
carry Mr. Mulford the nice things you've mustered in that<lb/>  
basket, all the same as if he was pope.”</p>
            <p>“This is a subject we had better drop,” Rose quietly<lb/>  
observed.</p>
            <p>“Anything to oblige you, Miss Rose, though religion is<lb/>  
a matter it would do me no harm to talk about once and<lb/>  
awhile. It's many a long year since I've had time and<lb/>  
opportunity to bring my thoughts to dwell on holy things.<lb/>  
Ever since I left my mother's side, I've been a wanderer<lb/>  
in my mind, as much as in my body.”</p>
            <p>“Poor Jack! I understand and feel for your sufferings;<lb/>  
but a better time will come, when you may return to the<lb/>  
habits of your youth, and to the observances of your church.”</p>
            <p>“I do n't know that, Miss Rose; I do n't know that,”<lb/>  
answered Tier, placing the elbow of his short arm on the<lb/>  
seemingly shorter leg, and bending his head so low as to<lb/>  
lean his face on the palm of the hand, an attitude in which<lb/>  
he appeared to be suffering keenly through his <lb/>recollections. “Childhood and innocence never come back to us<lb/>  
in this world. What the grave may do, we shall all learn<lb/>  
in time.”</p>
            <p>“Innocence can return to all with repentance, Jack;<lb/>  
and the heart that prompts you to do acts as generous as<lb/>
               <pb n="057"/>  
this you are now engaged in, must contain some good seed<lb/>  
yet.”</p>
            <p>“If Jack will go to a praste and just confess, when he<lb/>  
can find a father, it will do his sowl good,” said Biddy,<lb/>  
who was touched by the mental suffering of the strange<lb/>  
little being at her side.</p>
            <p>But the necessity of managing the boat soon compelled<lb/>  
its coxswain to raise his head, and to attend to his duty.<lb/>  
The wind sometimes came in puffs, and at such moments<lb/>  
Jack saw that the large sail of the light-house boat required<lb/>  
watching, a circumstance that induced him to shake off his<lb/>  
melancholy, and give his mind more exclusively to the <lb/>business before him. As for Rose, she sympathised deeply<lb/>  
with Jack Tier, for she knew his history, his origin, the<lb/>  
story of his youth, and the well-grounded causes of his<lb/>  
contrition and regrets. From her, Jack had concealed <lb/>nothing, the gentle commiseration of one like Rose being a<lb/>  
balm to wounds that had bled for long and bitter years.<lb/>  
The great poet of our language, and the greatest that ever<lb/>  
lived, perhaps, short of the inspired writers of the Old <lb/>Testament, and old Homer and Dante, has well reminded us<lb/>  
that the “little beetle,” in yielding its breath, can “feel a<lb/>  
pang as great as when a giant dies.” Thus is it, too, in<lb/>  
morals. Abasement, and misery, and poverty, and sin,<lb/>  
may, and all do, contribute to lower the tone of our moral<lb/>  
existence; but the principle that has been planted by <lb/>nature, can be eradicated by nature only. It exists as long<lb/>  
as we exist; and if dormant for a time, under the pressure<lb/>  
of circumstances, it merely lies, in the moral system, like<lb/>  
the acorn, or the chestnut, in the ground, waiting its time<lb/>  
and season to sprout, and bud, and blossom. Should that<lb/>  
time never arrive, it is not because the seed is not there,<lb/>  
but because it is neglected. Thus was it with the singular<lb/>  
being of whose feelings we have just spoken. The germ<lb/>  
of goodness had been implanted early in him, and was<lb/>  
nursed with tenderness and care, until, self-willed, and <lb/>governed by passion; he had thrown off the connections of<lb/>  
youth and childhood, to connect himself with Spike—a<lb/>  
connection that had left him what he was. Before closing<lb/>  
our legend, we shall have occasion to explain it.</p>
            <p>“We have run our hour; Miss Rose,” resumed Jack,<lb/>
               <pb n="058"/>  
breaking a continued silence, during which the boat had<lb/>  
passed through a long line of water; “we have run our<lb/>  
hour, and ought to be near the rock we are in search of.<lb/>  
But the morning is so dark that I fear we shall have <lb/>difficulty in finding it. It will never do to run past it, and we<lb/>  
must haul closer into the reef, and shorten sail, that we<lb/>  
may be sartain to make no such mistake.”</p>
            <p>Rose begged her companion to omit no precaution, as<lb/>  
it would be dreadful to fail in their search, after incurring<lb/>  
so much risk in their own persons.</p>
            <p>“Harry may be sleeping on the sea-weed of which you<lb/>  
spoke,” she added, “and the danger of passing him will be<lb/>  
much increased in such a case. What a gloomy and <lb/>frightful spot is this, in which to abandon a human being! I fear,<lb/>  
Jack, that we have come faster than we have supposed, and<lb/>  
may already have passed the rock.”</p>
            <p>“I hope not, Miss Rose—it seemed to me a good two<lb/>  
leagues to the place where I saw him, and the boat is fast<lb/>  
that will run two leagues in an hour.”</p>
            <p>“We do not know the time, Jack, and are obliged to<lb/>  
guess at that as well as at the distance. How very dark it<lb/>  
is!”</p>
            <p>Dark, in one sense, it was not, though Rose's <lb/>apprehensions, doubtless, induced her to magnify every evil. The<lb/>  
clouds certainly lessened the light of the moon; but there<lb/>  
was still enough of the last to enable one to see <lb/>surrounding objects; and most especially to render distinct the<lb/>  
character of the solitude that reigned over the place.</p>
            <p>The proximity of the reef, which formed a weather shore<lb/>  
to the boat, prevented anything like a swell on the water,<lb/>  
notwithstanding the steadiness and strength of the breeze,<lb/>  
which had now blown for near twenty-four hours. The<lb/>  
same wind, in open water, would have raised sea enough<lb/>  
to cause a ship to pitch, or roll; whereas, the light-house<lb/>  
boat, placed where she was, scarce rose and fell under the<lb/>  
undulations of the channel through which she was <lb/>glancing.</p>
            <p>“This is a good boat, and a fast boat too,” observed<lb/>  
Jack Tier, after he had luffed up several minutes, in order<lb/>  
to make sure of his proximity to the reef; “and it might<lb/>  
carry us all safe enough to Key West, or certainly back to<lb/>
               <pb n="059"/>  
the Dry Tortugas, was we inclined to try our hands at<lb/>  
either.”</p>
            <p>“I cannot quit my aunt,” said Rose, quickly, “so we<lb/>  
will not even think of any such thing.”</p>
            <p>“No, 't would never do to abandon the missus,” said<lb/>  
Biddy, “and she on the wrack wid us, and falin' the want<lb/>  
of wather as much as ourselves.”</p>
            <p>“We three have sartainly gone through much in <lb/>company,” returned Jack, “and it ought to make us friends<lb/>  
for life.”</p>
            <p>“I trust it will, Jack; I hope, when we return to New<lb/>  
York, to see you among us, anchored, as you would call<lb/>  
it, for the rest of your days under my aunt's roof, or under<lb/>  
my own, should I ever have one.”</p>
            <p>“No, Miss Rose, my business is with the Swash and<lb/>  
her captain. I shall stick by both, now I've found 'em<lb/>  
again, until they once more desart me. A man's duty is<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">his</hi> duty, and a woman's duty is <hi rend="italics">her</hi> duty.”</p>
            <p>“You same to like the brig and her captain, Jack Tier,”<lb/>  
observed Biddy, “and there's no use in gainsaying such a<lb/>  
likin'. What <hi rend="italics">will</hi> come to pass, must come to pass. <lb/>Captain Spike is a mighty great sailor, anyway.”</p>
            <p>“He's a willian!” muttered Jack.</p>
            <p>“There!” cried Rose, almost breathless, “there is a<lb/>  
rock above the water, surely. Do not fly by it so swiftly,<lb/>  
Jack, but let us stop and examine it.”</p>
            <p>“There is a rock, sure enough, and a large piece it is,”<lb/>  
answered Tier. “We will go alongside of it, and see what<lb/>  
it is made of. Biddy shall be boat-keeper, while you and<lb/>  
I, Miss Rose, explore.”</p>
            <p>Jack had thrown the boat into the wind, and was <lb/>shooting close alongside of the reef, even while speaking. The<lb/>  
party found no difficulty in landing; the margin of the rock<lb/>  
admitting the boat to lie close alongside of it, and its <lb/>surface being even and dry. Jack had brailed the sail, and<lb/>  
he brought the painter ashore, and fastened it securely to<lb/>  
a fragment of stone, that made a very sufficient anchor. In<lb/>  
addition to this precaution, a lazy painter was put into<lb/>  
Biddy's hands, and she was directed not to let go of it<lb/>  
while her companions were absent. These arrangements<lb/>
               <pb n="060"/>  
concluded, Rose and Jack commenced a hurried <lb/>examination of the spot.</p>
            <p>A few minutes sufficed to give our adventurers a <lb/>tolerably accurate notion of the general features of the place on<lb/>  
which they had landed. It was a considerable portion of<lb/>  
the reef that was usually above water, and which had even<lb/>  
some fragments of soil, or sand, on which was a stinted<lb/>  
growth of bushes. Of these last, however, there were very<lb/>  
few, nor were there many spots of the sand. Drift-wood<lb/>  
and sea-weed were lodged in considerable quantities about<lb/>  
its margin, and, in places, piles of both had been tossed<lb/>  
upon the rock itself, by the billows of former gales of wind.<lb/>  
Nor was it long before Jack discovered a turtle that had<lb/>  
been up to a hillock of sand, probably to deposit its eggs.<lb/>  
There was enough of the sportsman in Jack, <lb/>notwithstanding the business he was on, to turn this animal; though<lb/>  
with what object, he might have been puzzled himself to<lb/>  
say. This exploit effected, Jack followed Rose as fast as<lb/>  
his short legs would permit, our heroine pressing forward<lb/>  
eagerly, though almost without hope, in order to assertain<lb/>  
if Mulford were there.</p>
            <p>“I am afraid this is not the rock,” said Rose, nearly<lb/>  
breathless with her own haste, when Jack had overtaken<lb/>  
her. “I see nothing of him, and we have passed over most<lb/>  
of the place.”</p>
            <p>“Very true, Miss Rose,” answered her companion, who<lb/>  
was in a good humour on account of his capture of the <lb/>turtle; “but there are other rocks besides this. Ha! what<lb/>  
was that, yonder,” pointing with a finger, “here, more <lb/>toward the brig. As I'm a sinner, there was a flashing, as<lb/>  
of fire.”</p>
            <p>“If a fire, it must be that made by Harry. Let us go<lb/>  
to the spot at once.”</p>
            <p>Jack led the way, and, sure enough, he soon reached a<lb/>  
place where the embers of what had been a considerable<lb/>  
body of fire, were smouldering on the rock. The wind had<lb/>  
probably caused some brand to kindle momentarily, which<lb/>  
was the object that had caught Tier's eye. No doubt any<lb/>  
longer remained of their having found the very place where<lb/>  
the mate had cooked his supper, and lighted his beacon,<lb/>  
though he himself was not near it. Around these embers<lb/>
               <pb n="061"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
were all the signs of Mulford's having made the meal, of<lb/>  
which Jack had seen the preparations. A portion of the<lb/>  
turtle, much the greater part of it, indeed, lay in its shell;<lb/>  
and piles of wood and sea-weed, both dry, had been placed<lb/>  
at hand, ready for use. A ship's topgallant-yard, with most<lb/>  
of its rope attached, lay with a charred end near the fire,<lb/>  
of where the fire had been, the wood having burned until<lb/>  
the flames went out for want of contact with other fuel.<lb/>  
There were many pieces of boards of pitch-pine in the <lb/>adjacent heap, and two or three beautiful planks of the same<lb/>  
wood, entire. In short, from the character and quantity<lb/>  
of the materials of this nature that had thus been heaped<lb/>  
together, Jack gave it as his opinion that some vessel,<lb/>  
freighted with lumber, had been wrecked to windward, and<lb/>  
that the adjacent rocks had been receiving the tribute of<lb/>  
her cargo. Wrecks are of very, very frequent occurrence<lb/>  
on the Florida Reef; and there are always moments when<lb/>  
such gleanings are to be made in some part of it or other.</p>
            <p>“I see no better way to give a call to the mate, Miss<lb/>  
Rose, than to throw some of this dry weed, and some of<lb/>  
this lumber on the fire,” said Jack, after he had rummaged<lb/>  
about the place sufficiently to become master of its <lb/>condition. “There is plenty of amunition, and here goes for a<lb/>  
broadside.”</p>
            <p>Jack had no great difficulty in effecting his object. In<lb/>  
a few minutes he succeeded in obtaining a flame, and then<lb/>  
he fed it with such fragments of the brands and boards as<lb/>  
were best adapted to his purpose. The flames extended<lb/>  
gradually, and by the time Tier had dragged the <lb/>topgallant-yard over the pile, and placed several planks, on their edges,<lb/>  
alongside of it, the whole was ready to burst into a blaze.<lb/>  
The light was shed athwart the rock for a long distance,<lb/>  
and the whole place, which was lately so gloomy and <lb/>obscure, now became gay, under the bright radiance of a <lb/>blazing fire.</p>
            <p>“There is a beacon-light that might almost be seen on<lb/>  
board!” said Jack, exulting in his success. If the mate<lb/>  
is anywhere in this latitude, he will soon turn up.”</p>
            <p>“I see nothing of him,” answered Rose, in a melancholy<lb/>  
voice. “Surely, surely, Jack, he cannot have left the rock<lb/>  
just as we have come to rescue him!”</p>
            <pb n="062"/>
            <p/>
            <p>Rose and her companion had turned their faces from the<lb/>  
fire to look in an opposite direction in quest of him they<lb/>  
sought. Unseen by them, a human form advanced swiftly<lb/>  
toward the fire, from a point on its other side. It advanced<lb/>  
nearer, then hesitated, afterward rushed forward with a<lb/>  
tread that caused the two to turn, and at the next moment,<lb/>  
Rose was clasped to the heart of Mulford.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> stories of the respective parties who had thus so<lb/>  
strangely met on that barren and isolated rock, were soon<lb/>  
told. Harry confirmed all of Jack's statements as to his<lb/>  
own proceedings, and Rose had little more to say than to<lb/>  
add how much her own affections had led her to risk in<lb/>  
his behalf. In a word, ten minutes made each fully <lb/>acquainted with the other's movements. Then Tier <lb/>considerately retired to the boat, under the pretence of minding<lb/>  
it, and seeing everything ready for a departure, but as much<lb/>  
to allow the lovers the ten or fifteen minutes of <lb/>uninterrupted discourse that they now enjoyed, as for any other reason.</p>
            <p>It was a strange scene that now offered on the rock. By<lb/>  
this time the fire was burning not only brightly, but fiercely,<lb/>  
shedding its bright light far and near. Under its most<lb/>  
brilliant rays stood Harry and Rose, both smiling and <lb/>happy, delighted in their meeting, and, for the moment, <lb/>forgetful of all but their present felicity. Never, indeed, had<lb/>  
Rose appeared more lovely than under these circumstances.<lb/>
               <pb n="063"/>  
Her face was radiant with those feelings which had so <lb/>recently changed from despair to delight—a condition that<lb/>  
is ever most propitious to beauty; and charms that always<lb/>  
appeared feminine and soft, now seemed elevated to a bright<lb/>  
benignancy that might best be likened to our fancied images<lb/>  
of angels. The mild, beaming, serene and intelligent blue<lb/>  
eyes, the cheeks flushed with happiness, the smiles that<lb/>  
came so easily, and were so replete with tenderness, and<lb/>  
the rich hair, deranged by the breeze, and moistened by the<lb/>  
air of the sea, each and all, perhaps, borrowed some <lb/>additional lustre from the peculiar light under which they were<lb/>  
exhibited. As for Harry, happiness had thrown all the <lb/>disadvantages of exposure, want of dress, and a face that had not<lb/>  
felt the razor for six-and-thirty hours, into the back-ground.<lb/>  
When he left the wreck, he had cast aside his cap and his<lb/>  
light summer jacket, in order that they might not <lb/>encumber him in swimming, but both had been recovered when<lb/>  
he returned with the boat to take off his friends. In his<lb/>  
ordinary sea attire, then, he now stood, holding Rose's two<lb/>  
hands in front of the fire, every garment clean and white<lb/>  
as the waters of the ocean could make them, but all <lb/>betraying some of the signs of his recent trials. His fine <lb/>countenance was full of the love he bore for the intrepid and<lb/>  
devoted girl who had risked so much in his behalf; and a<lb/>  
painter might have wished to preserve the expression of<lb/>  
ardent, manly admiration which glowed in his face, <lb/>answering to the gentle sympathy and womanly tenderness it met<lb/>  
in that of Rose.</p>
            <p>The back-ground of this picture was the wide, even <lb/>surface of the coral reef, with its exterior setting of the dark<lb/>  
and gloomy sea. On the side of the channel, however, <lb/>appeared the boat, already winded, with Biddy still on the<lb/>  
rock, looking kindly at the lovers by the fire, while Jack<lb/>  
was holding the painter, beginning to manifest a little <lb/>impatience at the delay.</p>
            <p>“They'll stay there an hour, holding each other's hands,<lb/>  
and looking into each other's faces,” half grumbled the<lb/>  
little, rotund, assistant-steward, anxious to be on his way<lb/>  
back to the brig, “unless a body gives 'em a call. Captain<lb/>  
Spike will be in no very good humour to receive you and<lb/>
               <pb n="064"/>  
me on board ag'in, if he should find out what sort of a trip<lb/>  
we've been making hereaway.”</p>
            <p>“Let 'em alone—let 'em alone, Jacky,” answered the<lb/>  
good-natured and kind-hearted Irish woman. “It's happy<lb/>  
they bees, jist now, and it does my eyes good to look at<lb/>  
'em.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, they're happy enough, <hi rend="italics">now;</hi> I only hope it may<lb/>  
last.”</p>
            <p>“Last! what should help its lasting? Miss Rose is so<lb/>  
good, and so handsome—and she's a fortin', too; and the<lb/>  
mate so nice a young man. Think of the likes of them,<lb/>  
Jack, wantin' the blessed gift of wather, and all within one<lb/>  
day and two nights. Sure it's Providence that takes care<lb/>  
of, and not we ourselves! Kings on their thrones is n't as<lb/>  
happy as <hi rend="italics">them</hi> at this moment.”</p>
            <p>“Men's willians!” growled Jack; “and more fools <lb/>women for trustin' 'em.”</p>
            <p>“Not sich a nice young man as our mate, Jacky; no,<lb/>  
not he. Now the mate of the ship I came from Liverpool<lb/>  
in, this time ten years agone, he was a villain. He grudged<lb/>  
us our potaties, and our own bread; and he grudged us<lb/>  
every dhrap of swate wather that went into our mouths.<lb/>  
Call him a villain, if you will, Jack; but niver call the<lb/>  
likes of Mr. Mulford by so hard a name.”</p>
            <p>“I wish him well, and nothing else; and for that very<lb/>  
reason must put a stop to his looking so fondly into that<lb/>  
young woman's face. Time wont stand still, Biddy, to suit<lb/>  
the wishes of lovers; and Stephen Spike is a man not to<lb/>  
be trifled with. Halloo, there, maty! It's high time to<lb/>  
think of getting under way.”</p>
            <p>At this summons both Harry and Rose started, becoming<lb/>  
aware of the precious moments they were losing. Carrying<lb/>  
a large portion of the turtle, the former moved toward the<lb/>  
craft, in which all were seated in less than three minutes,<lb/>  
with the sail loose, and the boat in motion. For a few<lb/>  
moments the mate was so much occupied with Rose, that<lb/>  
he did not advert to the course; but one of his experience<lb/>  
could not long be misled on such a point, and he turned<lb/>  
suddenly to Tier, who was steering, to remonstrate.</p>
            <p>“How's this, Jack!” cried Mulford; “you've got the<lb/>  
boat's head the wrong way.”</p>
            <pb n="065"/>
            <p/>
            <milestone unit="collation"/>
            <p>“Not I, sir. She's heading for the brig as straight as<lb/>  
she can go. This wind favours us on both legs; and it's<lb/>  
lucky it does, for't will be hard on upon daylight afore we<lb/>  
are alongside of her. You'll want half an hour of dark,<lb/>  
at the very least, to get a good start of the Swash, in case<lb/>  
she makes sail a'ter you.”</p>
            <p>“Straight for the brig!—what have we to do with the<lb/>  
brig? Our course is for Key West, unless it might be<lb/>  
better to run down before the wind to the Dry Tortugas<lb/>  
again, and look for the sloop-of-war. Duty, and perhaps<lb/>  
my own safety, tells me to let Captain Mull know what<lb/>  
Spike is about with the Swash; and I shall not hesitate a<lb/>  
moment about doing it, after all that has passed. Give me<lb/>  
the helm, Jack, and let us ware short round on our heel.”</p>
            <p>“Never, master maty—never. I must go back to the<lb/>  
brig. Miss Rose, there, knows that my business is with<lb/>  
Stephen Spike, and with him only.”</p>
            <p>“And I must return to my aunt, Harry,” put in Rose,<lb/>  
herself. “It would never do for me to desert my aunt, you<lb/>  
know.”</p>
            <p>“And I have been taken from that rock, to be given up<lb/>  
to the tender mercies of Spike again?”</p>
            <p>This was said rather in surprise, than in a complaining<lb/>  
way; and it at once induced Rose to tell the young man<lb/>  
the whole of their project.</p>
            <p>“Never, Harry, never,” she said firmly. “It is our <lb/>intention to return to the brig ourselves, and let you escape in the<lb/>  
boat afterwards. Jack Tier is of opinion this can be done<lb/>  
without much risk, if we use proper caution and do not<lb/>  
lose too much time. On no account would I consent to<lb/>  
place you in the hands of Spike again—death would be<lb/>  
preferable to that, Harry!”</p>
            <p>“And on no account can or will I consent to place <hi rend="italics">you  
 </hi>
               <lb/> again in the hands of Spike, Rose,” answered the young<lb/>  
man. “Now that we know his intentions, such an act<lb/>  
would be almost impious.”</p>
            <p>“Remember my aunt, dear Harry. What would be her<lb/>  
situation in the morning, when she found herself deserted<lb/>  
by her niece and Biddy—by me, whom she has nursed and<lb/>  
watched from childhood, and whom she loves so well.”</p>
            <p>“I shall not deny your obligations to your aunt, Rose,<lb/>
               <pb n="066"/>  
and your duty to her under ordinary circumstances. But<lb/>  
these are not ordinary circumstances; and it would be<lb/>  
courting the direst misfortunes, nay, almost braving <lb/>Providence, to place yourself in the hands of that scoundrel<lb/>  
again, now that you are clear of them.”</p>
            <p>“Spike's a willian!” muttered Jack.</p>
            <p>“And my desartin' the missus would be a sin that no<lb/>  
praste would overlook aisily,” put in Biddy. “When<lb/>  
Miss Rose told me of this v'y'ge that she meant to make in<lb/>  
the boat wid Jack Tier, I asked to come along, that I<lb/>  
might take care of her, and see that there was plenty of<lb/>  
wather; but ill-luck befall me if I would have t'ought of<lb/>  
sich a thing, and the missus desarted.”</p>
            <p>“We can then run alongside of the brig, and put Biddy<lb/>  
and Jack on board of her,” said Mulford, reflecting a <lb/>moment on what had just been said, “when you and I can<lb/>  
make the best of our way to Key West, where the means<lb/>  
of sending government vessels out after the Swash will<lb/>  
soon offer. In this way we can not only get our friends out<lb/>  
of the lion's jaws, but keep out of them ourselves.”</p>
            <p>“Reflect a moment, Harry,” said Rose, in a low voice,<lb/>  
but not without tenderness in its tones; “it would not do<lb/>  
for me to go off alone with you in this boat.”</p>
            <p>“Not when you have confessed your willingness to go<lb/>  
over the wide world with me, Rose—with me, and with<lb/>  
me only?”</p>
            <p>“Not even then, Harry. I know you will think better<lb/>  
of this, when your generous nature has time to reason with<lb/>  
your heart, on my account.”</p>
            <p>“I can only answer in your own words, Rose—never.<lb/>  
If you return to the Swash, I shall go on board with you,<lb/>  
and throw defiance into the very teeth of Spike. I know<lb/>  
the men do not dislike me, and, perhaps, assisted by Señor<lb/>  
Montefalderon, and a few friends among the people, I can<lb/>  
muster a force that will prevent my being thrown into the<lb/>  
sea.”</p>
            <p>Rose burst into tears, and then succeeded many minutes,<lb/>  
during which Mulford was endeavouring, with manly <lb/>tenderness, to soothe her. As soon as our heroine recovered<lb/>  
her self-command, she began to discuss the matter at issue<lb/>  
between them more coolly. For half an hour everything<lb/>
               <pb n="067"/>  
was urged by each that feeling, affection, delicacy, or <lb/>distrust of Spike could well urge, and Mulford was slowly <lb/>getting the best of the argument, as well he might, the truth<lb/>  
being mostly of his side. Rose was bewildered, really<lb/>  
feeling a strong reluctance to quit her aunt, even with so<lb/>  
justifiable a motive, but principally shrinking from the <lb/>appearance of going off alone in a boat, and almost in the<lb/>  
open sea, with Mulford. Had she loved Harry less, her<lb/>  
scruples might not have been so active, but the <lb/>consciousness of the strength of her attachment, as well as her fixed<lb/>  
intention to become his wife the moment it was in her<lb/>  
power to give him her hand with the decencies of her sex,<lb/>  
contributed strangely to prevent her yielding to the young<lb/>  
man's reasoning. On the subject of the aunt, the mate<lb/>  
made out so good a case, that it was apparent to all in the<lb/>  
boat Rose would have to abandon that ground of refusal.<lb/>  
Spike had no object to gain by ill-treating Mrs. Budd; and<lb/>  
the probability certainly was that he would get rid of her<lb/>  
as soon as he could, and in the most easy manner. This<lb/>  
was so apparent to all, that Harry had little difficulty in<lb/>  
getting Rose to assent to its probability. But there <lb/>remained the reluctance to go off alone with the mate in a<lb/>  
boat. This part of the subject was more difficult to <lb/>manage than the other; and Mulford betrayed as much by the<lb/>  
awkwardness with which he managed it. At length the<lb/>  
discussion was brought to a close by Jack Tier suddenly<lb/>  
saying,—</p>
            <p>“Yonder is the brig; and we are heading for her as<lb/>  
straight as if she was the pole, and the keel of this boat was a<lb/>  
compass. I see how it is, Miss Rose, and a'ter all, I must<lb/>  
give in. I suppose some other opportunity will offer for<lb/>  
me to get on board of the brig ag'in, and I'll trust to that.<lb/>  
If you won't go off with the mate alone, I suppose you'll<lb/>  
not refuse to go off in my company.”</p>
            <p>“Will you accompany us, Jack? This is more than I<lb/>  
had hoped for! Yes, Harry, if Jack Tier will be of the<lb/>  
party, I will trust my aunt to Biddy, and go with you to<lb/>  
Key West, in order to escape from Spike.”</p>
            <p>This was said so rapidly, and so unexpectedly, as to take<lb/>  
Mulford completely by surprise. Scarce believing what he<lb/>  
heard, the young man was disposed, at first, to feel hurt,<lb/>
               <pb n="068"/>  
though a moment's reflection showed him that he ought to<lb/>  
rejoice in the result let the cause be what it might.</p>
            <p>“More than I had hoped for!” he could not refrain from<lb/>  
repeating a little bitterly; “is Jack Tier, then, of so much<lb/>  
importance, that <hi rend="italics">his</hi> company is thought preferable to<lb/>  
mine!”</p>
            <p>“Hush, Harry!” said Rose, laying her hand on <lb/>Mulford's arm, by way of strengthening her appeal. “Do not<lb/>  
say <hi rend="italics">that</hi>. You are ignorant of circumstances; at another<lb/>  
time you shall know them, but not now. Let it be enough<lb/>  
for the present, that I promise to accompany you if Jack<lb/>  
will be of our party.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, Miss Rose, I will be of the party, seeing there<lb/>  
is no other way of getting the lamb out of the jaws of the<lb/>  
wolf. A'ter all, it may be the wisest thing I can do, though<lb/>  
back to the Swash I must and <hi rend="italics">will</hi> come, powder or no<lb/>  
powder, treason or no treason, at the first opportunity. Yes,<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">my</hi> business is with the Molly, and to the Molly I shall <lb/>return. It's lucky, Miss Rose, since you have made up your<lb/>  
mind to ship for this new cruise, that I bethought me of<lb/>  
telling Biddy to make up a bundle of duds for you. This<lb/>  
carpet-bag has a change or two in it, and all owing to my<lb/>  
forethought. Your woman said ‘Miss Rose will come<lb/>  
back wid us, Jack, and what's the use of rumplin' the<lb/>  
clothes for a few hours' sail in the boat;’ but I knew <lb/>womankind better, and foreseed that if master mate fell in<lb/>  
alongside of you ag'in, you would not be apt to part <lb/>company very soon.”</p>
            <p>“I thank you, Jack, for the provision made for my <lb/>comfort; though some money would have added to it <lb/>materially. My purse has a little gold in it, but a very little,<lb/>  
and I fear you are not much better off, Harry. It will be<lb/>  
awkward to find ourselves in Key West penniless.”</p>
            <p>“We shall not be quite that. I left the brig absolutely<lb/>  
without a cent, but foreseeing that necessity might make<lb/>  
them of use, I borrowed half a dozen of the doubloons from<lb/>  
the bag of Señor Montefalderon, and, fortunately, they are<lb/>  
still in my pocket. All I am worth in the world is in a<lb/>  
bag of half-eagles, rather more than a hundred altogether,<lb/>  
which I left in my chest, in my own state-room aboard the<lb/>  
brig.”</p>
            <pb n="069"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“You'll find that in the carpet-bag too, master mate,”<lb/>  
said Jack, coolly.</p>
            <p>“Find what, man—not my money, surely?”</p>
            <p>“Ay, every piece of it. Spike broke into your chest<lb/>  
this a'ternoon, and made me hold the tools while he was<lb/>  
doing it. He found the bag, and overhauled it—a hundred<lb/>  
and seven half, eleven quarter, and one full-grown eagle,<lb/>  
was the count. When he had done the job, he put all<lb/>  
back ag'in, a'ter giving me the full-grown eagle for my<lb/>  
share of the plunder, and told me to say nothing of what<lb/>  
I had seen. I did say nothing, but I did a good bit of<lb/>  
work, for, while he was at supper. I confiserated that bag,<lb/>  
as they call it—and you will find it there among Miss<lb/>  
Rose's clothes, with the full-grown gentleman back in his<lb/>  
nest ag'in.”</p>
            <p>“This is being not only honest, Tier,” cried Mulford,<lb/>  
heartily, “but thoughtful. One-half that money shall be<lb/>  
yours for this act.”</p>
            <p>“I thank'e, sir; but I'll not touch a cent of it. It came<lb/>  
hard, I know, Mr. Mulford; for my own hands have <lb/>smarted too much with tar, not to know that the seaman ‘earns<lb/>  
his money like the horse.’ ”</p>
            <p>“Still it would not be ‘spending it like an ass,’ Jack,<lb/>  
to give you a portion of mine. But there will be other <lb/>opportunities to talk of this. It is a sign of returning to the<lb/>  
concerns of life, Rose, that money begins to be of interest<lb/>  
to us. How little did we think of the doubloons, or <lb/>half-eagles, a few hours since, when on the wreck!”</p>
            <p>“It was wather that we t'ought of then,” put in Biddy.<lb/>  
“Goold is good in a market, or in a town, or to send back<lb/>  
to Ireland, to help a body's aged fader or mudder in <lb/>comfort wid; but wather is the blessed thing on a wrack!”</p>
            <p>“The brig is coming quite plainly into view, and you<lb/>  
had better give me the helm, Jack. It is time to bethink<lb/>  
us of the manner of approaching her, and how we are to<lb/>  
proceed when alongside.”</p>
            <p>This was so obviously true, that everybody felt disposed<lb/>  
to forget all other matters, in order to conduct the <lb/>proceedings of the next twenty minutes, with the necessary <lb/>prudence and caution. When Mulford first took the helm,<lb/>  
the brig was just coming clearly into view, though still<lb/>
               <pb n="070"/>  
looking a little misty and distant. She might then have<lb/>  
been half a league distant, and would not have been visible<lb/>  
at all by that light, but for the circumstance that she had<lb/>  
no back-ground to swallow up her outlines. Drawn against<lb/>  
clouds, above which the rays of the moon were shed, her<lb/>  
tracery was to be discerned, however, and, minute by<lb/>  
minute, it was getting to be more and more distinct, until<lb/>  
it was now so plainly to be seen as to admonish the mate<lb/>  
of the necessity of preparation in the manner mentioned.</p>
            <p>Tier now communicated to the mate his own proposed<lb/>  
manner of proceeding. The brig tended to the trades, the<lb/>  
tides having very little influence on her, in the bight of the<lb/>  
reef where she lay. As the wind stood at about east <lb/>south-east, the brig's stern pointed to about west north-west,<lb/>  
while the boat was coming down the passage from a <lb/>direction nearly north from her, having, as a matter of course,<lb/>  
the wind just free enough to lay her course. Jack's plan<lb/>  
was to pass the brig to windward, and having got well on<lb/>  
her bow, to brail the sail, and drift down upon her, <lb/>expecting to fall in alongside, abreast of the fore-chains, into<lb/>  
which he had intended to help Biddy, and to ascend <lb/>himself, when he supposed that Mulford would again make<lb/>  
sail, and carry off his mistress. To this scheme the mate<lb/>  
objected that it was awkward, and a little lubberly. He<lb/>  
substituted one in its place that differed in seamanship, and<lb/>  
which was altogether better. Instead of passing to <lb/>windward, Mulford suggested the expediency of approaching<lb/>  
to leeward, and of coming alongside under the open <lb/>bow-port, letting the sheet fly and brailing the sail, when the<lb/>  
boat should be near enough to carry her to the point of<lb/>  
destination without further assistance from her canvass.</p>
            <p>Jack Tier took his officer's improvement on his own<lb/>  
plan in perfect good part, readily and cheerfully expressing<lb/>  
his willingness to aid the execution of it all that lay in his<lb/>  
power. As the boat sailed unusually well, there was barely<lb/>  
time to explain to each individual his or her part in the <lb/>approaching critical movements, ere the crisis itself drew<lb/>  
near; then each of the party became silent and anxious,<lb/>  
and events were regarded rather than words.</p>
            <p>It is scarcely necessary to say that Mulford sailed a boat<lb/>  
well. He held the sheet in his hand, as the little craft<lb/>
               <pb n="071"/>  
came up under the lee-quarter of the brig, while Jack stood<lb/>  
by the brail. The eyes of the mate glanced over the hull<lb/>  
of the vessel to ascertain, if possible, who might be stirring;<lb/>  
but not a sign of life could he detect on board her. This<lb/>  
very silence made Mulford more distrustful and anxious,<lb/>  
for he feared a trap was set for him. He expected to see<lb/>  
the head of one of the blacks at least peering over the <lb/>bulwarks, but nothing like a man was visible. It was too late<lb/>  
to pause, however, and the sheet was slowly eased off, Jack<lb/>  
hauling on the brail at the same time; the object being to<lb/>  
prevent the sail's flapping, and the sound reaching the ears<lb/>  
of Spike. As Mulford used great caution, and had <lb/>previously schooled Jack on the subject, this important point<lb/>  
was successfully achieved. Then the mate put his helm<lb/>  
down, and the boat shot up under the brig's lee-bow. Jack<lb/>  
was ready to lay hold of one of the bow-sprit shrouds, and<lb/>  
presently the boat was breasted up under the desired port,<lb/>  
and secured in that position. Mulford quitted the <lb/>stern-sheets, and cast a look in upon deck. Nothing was to be<lb/>  
seen, though he heard the heavy breathing of the blacks,<lb/>  
both of whom were sound asleep on a sail that they had<lb/>  
spread on the forecastle.</p>
            <p>The mate whispered for Biddy to come to the port. This<lb/>  
the Irishwoman did at once, having kissed Rose, and<lb/>  
taken her leave of her previously. Tier also came to the<lb/>  
port, through which he passed, getting on deck with a view<lb/>  
to assist Biddy, who was awkward, almost as a matter of<lb/>  
course, to pass through the same opening. He had just<lb/>  
succeeded, when the whole party was startled, some of them<lb/>  
almost petrified, indeed, by a hail from the quarter-deck<lb/>  
in the well-known, deep tones of Spike.</p>
            <p>“For'ard, there?” hailed the captain. Receiving no<lb/>  
answer, he immediately repeated, in a shorter, quicker<lb/>  
call, “Forecastle, there?”</p>
            <p>“Sir,” answered Jack Tier, who by this time had come<lb/>  
to his senses.</p>
            <p>“Who has the look-out on that forecastle?”</p>
            <p>“I have it, sir—I, Jack Tier. You know, sir, I was to<lb/>  
have it from two 'till daylight.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, I remember now. How does the brig ride to<lb/>  
her anchor?”</p>
            <pb n="072"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“As steady as a church, sir. She's had no more sheer<lb/>  
the whole watch than if she was moored head and starn.”</p>
            <p>“Does the wind stand as it did?”</p>
            <p>“No change, sir. As dead a trade wind as ever blowed.”</p>
            <p>“What hard breathing is that I hear for'ard?”</p>
            <p>“'T is the two niggers, sir. They've turned in on<lb/>  
deck, and are napping it off at the rate of six knots.<lb/>  
There's no keepin' way with a nigger in snorin'.”</p>
            <p>“I thought I heard loud whispering, too, but I suppose<lb/>  
it was a sort of half-dream. I'm often in that way <lb/>now-a-days. Jack!”</p>
            <p>“Sir.”</p>
            <p>“Go to the scuttle-butt and get me a pot of fresh water<lb/>  
—my coppers are hot with hard thinking.”</p>
            <p>Jack did as ordered, and soon stood beneath the <lb/>coach-house deck with Spike, who had come out of his state-room,<lb/>  
heated and uneasy at he knew not what. The captain<lb/>  
drank a full pint of water at a single draught.</p>
            <p>“That's refreshing,” he said, returning Jack the <lb/>tin-pot, “and I feel the cooler for it. How much does it want<lb/>  
of daylight, Jack?”</p>
            <p>“Two hours, I think, sir. The order was passed to me<lb/>  
to have all hands called as soon as it was broad day.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, that is right. We must get our anchor and be off<lb/>  
as soon as there is light to do it in. Doubloons may melt<lb/>  
as well as flour, and are best cared for soon when cared<lb/>  
for at all.”</p>
            <p>“I shall see and give the call as soon as it is day. I<lb/>  
hope, Captain Spike, I can take the liberty of an old <lb/>shipmate, however, and say one thing to you, which is this—<lb/>  
look out for the Poughkeepsie, which is very likely to be<lb/>  
on your heels when you least expect her.”</p>
            <p>“That's your way of thinking, is it, Jack. Well, I<lb/>  
thank you, old one, for the hint, but have little fear of that<lb/>  
craft. We've had our legs together, and I think the brig<lb/>  
has the longest.”</p>
            <p>As the captain said this, he gaped like a hound, and<lb/>  
went into his state-room. Jack lingered on the <lb/>quarter-deck, waiting to hear him fairly in his berth, when he made<lb/>  
a sign to Biddy, who had got as far aft as the galley, where<lb/>  
she was secreted, to pass down into the cabin, as silently<lb/>
               <pb n="073"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
as possible. In a minute or two more, he moved forward,<lb/>  
singing in a low, cracked voice, as was often his practice,<lb/>  
and slowly made his way to the forecastle. Mulford was<lb/>  
just beginning to think the fellow had changed his mind,<lb/>  
and meant to stick by the brig, when the little, rotund <lb/>figure of the assistant-steward was seen passing through the<lb/>  
port, and to drop noiselessly on a thwart. Jack then moved<lb/>  
to the bow, and cast off the painter, the head of the boat<lb/>  
slowly falling off under the pressure of the breeze on that<lb/>  
part of her mast and sail which rose above the hull of the<lb/>  
Swash. Almost at the same moment, the mate let go the<lb/>  
stern-fast, and the boat was free.</p>
            <p>It required some care to set the sail without the canvas<lb/>  
flapping. It was done, however, before the boat fairly took<lb/>  
the breeze, when all was safe. In half a minute the wind<lb/>  
struck the sail, and away the little craft started, passing<lb/>  
swiftly ahead of the brig. Soon as far enough off, Mulford<lb/>  
put up his helm and wore short round, bringing the boat's<lb/>  
head to the northward, or in its proper direction; after<lb/>  
which they flew along before the wind, which seemed to<lb/>  
be increasing in force, with a velocity that really appeared<lb/>  
to defy pursuit. All this time the brig lay in its silence<lb/>  
and solitude, no one stirring on board her, and all, in fact,<lb/>  
Biddy alone excepted, profoundly ignorant of what had just<lb/>  
been passing alongside of her. Ten minutes of running<lb/>  
off with a flowing sheet, caused the Swash to look indistinct<lb/>  
and hazy again; in ten minutes more she was swallowed<lb/>  
up, hull, spars, and all, in the gloom of night.</p>
            <p>Mulford and Rose now felt something like that security,<lb/>  
without the sense of which happiness itself is but an <lb/>uneasy feeling, rendering the anticipations of evil the more<lb/>  
painful by the magnitude of the stake. There they sat,<lb/>  
now, in the stern-sheets by themselves, Jack Tier having<lb/>  
placed himself near the bows of the boat, to look out for<lb/>  
rocks, as well as to trim the craft. It was not long before<lb/>  
Rose was leaning on Harry's shoulder, and ere an hour<lb/>  
was past, she had fallen into a sweet sleep in that attitude,<lb/>  
the young man having carefully covered her person with a<lb/>  
capacious shawl, the same that had been used on the wreck.<lb/>  
As for Jack, he maintained his post in silence, sitting with<lb/>  
his arms crossed, and the hands thrust into the breast of<lb/>
               <pb n="074"/>  
his jacket, sailor fashion, a picture of nautical vigilance.<lb/>  
It was some time after Rose had fallen asleep, that this<lb/>  
singular being spoke for the first time.</p>
            <p>“Keep her away a bit, maty,” he said, “keep her away,<lb/>  
half a point or so. She's been travelin' like a racer since<lb/>  
we left the brig; and yonder's the first streak of day.”</p>
            <p>“By the time we have been running,” observed Mulford,<lb/>  
“I should think we must be getting near the northern side<lb/>  
of the reef.”</p>
            <p>“All of that, sir, depend on it. Here's a rock close<lb/>  
aboard on us, to which we're comin' fast—just off here,<lb/>  
on our weather-bow, that looks to me like the place where<lb/>  
you landed a'ter that swim, and where we had stowed <lb/>ourselves when Stephen Spike made us out, and gave chase.”</p>
            <p>“It is surprising to me, Jack, that you should have any<lb/>  
fancy to stick by a man of Spike's character. He is a<lb/>  
precious rascal, as we all can see, now, and you are rather<lb/>  
an honest sort of fellow.”</p>
            <p>“Do you love the young woman there, that's lying in<lb/>  
your arms, as it might be, and whom you say you wish to<lb/>  
marry.”</p>
            <p>“The question is a queer one, but it is easily answered.<lb/>  
More than my life, Jack.”</p>
            <p>“Well, how happens it that <hi rend="italics">you</hi> succeed, when the world<lb/>  
has so many other young men who might please her as<lb/>  
well as yourself.”</p>
            <p>“It may be that no other loves her as well, and she has<lb/>  
had the sagacity to discover it.”</p>
            <p>“Quite likely. So it is with me and Stephen Spike. I<lb/>  
fancy a man whom other folk despise and condemn. <hi rend="italics">Why  
 </hi>
               <lb/> I stand by him is my own secret; but stand by him I do<lb/>  
and will.”</p>
            <p>“This is all very strange, after your conduct on the<lb/>  
island, and your conduct to-night. I shall not disturb your<lb/>  
secret, however, Jack, but leave you to enjoy it by <lb/>yourself. Is this the rock of which you spoke, that we are now<lb/>  
passing?”</p>
            <p>“The same; and there's the spot in which we was<lb/>  
stowed when they made us out from the brig; and <lb/>hereaway, a cable's length, more or less, the wreck of that<lb/>  
Mexican craft must lie.”</p>
            <pb n="075"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“What is that rising above the water, thereaway, Jack;<lb/>  
more on our weather-beam?”</p>
            <p>“I see what you mean, sir; it looks like a spar. By<lb/>  
George! there's two on 'em; and they <hi rend="italics">do</hi> seem to be the<lb/>  
schooner's masts.”</p>
            <p>Sure enough! a second look satisfied Mulford that two<lb/>  
mast-heads were out of water, and that within a hundred<lb/>  
yards of the place the boat was running past. Standing<lb/>  
on a short distance, or far enough to give himself room,<lb/>  
the mate put his helm down, and tacked the boat. The<lb/>  
flapping of the sail, and the little movement of shifting over<lb/>  
the sheet, awoke Rose, who was immediately apprized of<lb/>  
the discovery. As soon as round, the boat went glancing<lb/>  
up to the spars, and presently was riding by one, Jack Tier<lb/>  
having caught hold of a topmast-shroud, when Mulford let<lb/>  
fly his sheet again, and luffed short up to the spot. By<lb/>  
this time the increasing light was sufficiently strong to <lb/>render objects distinct, when near by, and no doubt remained<lb/>  
any longer in the mind of Mulford about the two <lb/>mast-heads being those of the unfortunate Mexican schooner.</p>
            <p>“Well, of all I have ever seen I've never see'd the like<lb/>  
of this afore!” exclaimed Jack. “When we left this here<lb/>  
craft, sir, you'll remember, she had almost turned turtle,<lb/>  
laying over so far as to bring her upper coamings under<lb/>  
water; now she stands right side up, as erect as if docked!<lb/>  
My navigation can't get along with this, Mr. Mulford, and<lb/>  
it does seem like witchcraft.”</p>
            <p>“It is certainly a very singular incident, Jack, and I have<lb/>  
been trying to come at its causes.”</p>
            <p>“Have you succeeded, Harry?” asked Rose, by this<lb/>  
time wide awake, and wondering like the others.</p>
            <p>“It must have happened in this wise. The wreck was<lb/>  
abandoned by us some little distance out here, to windward.<lb/>  
The schooner's masts, of course, pointed to leeward, and<lb/>  
when she drifted in here, they have first touched on a<lb/>  
shelving rock, and as they have been shoved up, little by<lb/>  
little, they have acted as levers to right the hull, until the<lb/>  
cargo has shifted back into its proper berth, which has<lb/>  
suddenly set the vessel up again.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, sir,” answered Jack, “all that might have <lb/>happened had she been above water, or any part of her above<lb/>
               <pb n="076"/>  
water; but you'll remember, maty, that soon after we left<lb/>  
her she went down.”</p>
            <p>“Not entirely. The wreck settled in the water no faster<lb/>  
after we had left it, than it had done before. It continued<lb/>  
to sink, inch by inch, as the air escaped, and no faster<lb/>  
after it had gone entirely out of sight than before; not as<lb/>  
fast, indeed, as the water became denser the lower it got.<lb/>  
The great argument against my theory, is the fact, that<lb/>  
after the hull got beneath the surface, the wind could not<lb/>  
act on it. This is true in one sense, however, and not in<lb/>  
another. The waves, or the pressure of the water produced<lb/>  
by the wind, might act on the hull for some time after we<lb/>  
ceased to see it. But the currents have set the craft in<lb/>  
here, and the hull floating always, very little force would<lb/>  
cant the craft. If the rock were shelving and slippery, I<lb/>  
see no great difficulty in the way; and the barrels may<lb/>  
have been so lodged, that a trifle would set them rolling<lb/>  
back again, each one helping to produce a change that<lb/>  
would move another. As for the ballast, that, I am certain,<lb/>  
could not shift, for it was stowed with great care. As the<lb/>  
vessel righted, the air still in her moved, and as soon as<lb/>  
the water permitted, it escaped by the hatches, when the<lb/>  
craft went down, as a matter of course. This air may<lb/>  
have aided in bringing the hull upright by its movements<lb/>  
in the water.”</p>
            <p>This was the only explanation to which the ingenuity<lb/>  
of Mulford could help him, under the circumstances, and<lb/>  
it may have been the right one, or not. There lay the<lb/>  
schooner, however, in some five or six fathoms of water,<lb/>  
with her two topmasts, and lower mast-heads out of the<lb/>  
element, as upright as if docked! It may all have <lb/>occurred as the mate fancied, or the unusual incident may have<lb/>  
been owing to some of the many mysterious causes which<lb/>  
baffle inquiry, when the agents are necessarily hidden from<lb/>  
examination.</p>
            <p>“Spike intends to come and look for this wreck, you<lb/>  
tell me, Jack; in the hope of getting at the doubloons it<lb/>  
contains?” said Mulford; when the boat had lain a minute<lb/>  
or two longer, riding by the mast-head.</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, sir; that's his notion, sir, and he'll be in a<lb/>  
great stew, as soon as he turns out, which must be about<lb/>
               <pb n="077"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
this time, and finds me missing; for I was to pilot him to<lb/>  
the spot.”</p>
            <p>“He'll want no pilot now. It will be scarcely possible<lb/>  
to pass anywhere near this and not see these spars. But<lb/>  
this discovery almost induces me to change my own plans.<lb/>  
What say <hi rend="italics">you,</hi> Rose? We have now reached the northern<lb/>  
side of the reef, when it is time to haul close by the wind,<lb/>  
if we wish to beat up to Key West. There is a moral <lb/>certainty, however, that the sloop-of-war is somewhere in the<lb/>  
neighbourhood of the Dry Tortugas, which are much the<lb/>  
most easily reached, being to leeward. We might run<lb/>  
down to the light-house by mid-day, while it is doubtful if<lb/>  
we could reach the town until to-morrow morning. I<lb/>  
should like exceedingly to have five minutes conversation<lb/>  
with the commander of the Poughkeepsie.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, to let him know where he will be likely to fall in<lb/>  
with the Molly Swash and her traitor master, Stephen<lb/>  
Spike,” cried Jack Tier. “Never mind, maty; let 'em<lb/>  
come on; both the Molly and her master have got long<lb/>  
legs and clean heels. Stephen Spike will show 'em how<lb/>  
to thread the channels of a reef.”</p>
            <p>“It is amazing to me, Jack, that you should stand by<lb/>  
your old captain in feeling, while you are helping to thwart<lb/>  
him, all you can, in his warmest wishes.”</p>
            <p>“He's a willian!” muttered Jack—“a reg'lar willian is<lb/>  
Stephen Spike!”</p>
            <p>“If a villain, why do you so evidently wish to keep him<lb/>  
out of the hands of the law? Let him be captured and <lb/>punished, as his crimes require.”</p>
            <p>“Men's willians, all round,” still muttered Jack.<lb/>  
“Hark'e, Mr. Mulford, I've sailed in the brig longer than<lb/>  
you, and know'd her in her comeliest and best days—when<lb/>  
she was young, and blooming, and lovely to the eye, as the<lb/>  
young creature at your side—and it would go to my heart<lb/>  
to have anything happen to <hi rend="italics">her</hi>. Then, I've know'd <lb/>Stephen a long time, too, and old shipmates get a feelin' for<lb/>  
each other, sooner or later. I tell you now, honestly, Mr.<lb/>  
Mulford, Captain Adam Mull shall never make a prisoner<lb/>  
of Stephen Spike, if I can prevent it.”</p>
            <p>The mate laughed at this sally, but Rose appeared<lb/>  
anxious to change the conversation, and she managed to<lb/>
               <pb n="078"/>  
open a discussion on the subject of the course it might be<lb/>  
best to steer. Mulford had several excellent reasons to urge<lb/>  
for wishing to run down to the islets, all of which, with a<lb/>  
single exception, he laid before his betrothed. The <lb/>concealed reason was one of the strongest of them all, as <lb/>usually happens when there is a reason to conceal, but of that<lb/>  
he took care to say nothing. The result was an <lb/>acquiescence on the part of Rose, whose consent was yielded<lb/>  
more to the influence of one particular consideration than<lb/>  
to all the rest united. That one was this: Harry had<lb/>  
pointed out to her the importance to himself of his <lb/>appearing early to denounce the character and movements of the<lb/>  
brig, lest, through his former situation in her, his own <lb/>conduct might be seriously called in question.</p>
            <p>As soon as the matter was determined, Jack was told to<lb/>  
let go his hold, the sheet was drawn aft, and away sped the<lb/>  
boat. No sooner did Mulford cause the little craft to keep<lb/>  
away than it almost flew, as if conscious it were bound to<lb/>  
its proper home, skimming swiftly over the waves, like a<lb/>  
bird returning eagerly to its nest. An hour later the party<lb/>  
breakfasted. While at this meal, Jack Tier pointed out<lb/>  
to the mate a white speck, in the south-eastern board, which<lb/>  
he took to be the brig coming through the passage, on her<lb/>  
way to the wreck.</p>
            <p>“No matter,” returned the mate. “Though we can see<lb/>  
her, she cannot see us. There is that much advantage in<lb/>  
our being small, Rose, if it do prevent our taking exercise<lb/>  
by walking the deck.”</p>
            <p>Soon after, Mulford made a very distant sail in the <lb/>north-western board, which he hoped might turn out to be the<lb/>  
Poughkeepsie. It was but another speck, but its position<lb/>  
was somewhat like that in which he had expected to meet<lb/>  
the sloop-of-war. The two vessels were so far apart that<lb/>  
one could not be seen from the other, and there was little<lb/>  
hope that the Poughkeepsie would detect Spike at his toil<lb/>  
on the wreck; but the mate fully expected that the ship<lb/>  
would go into the anchorage, among the islets, in order to<lb/>  
ascertain what had become of the schooner. If she did not<lb/>  
go in herself, she would be almost certain to send in a<lb/>  
boat.</p>
            <p>The party from the brigantine had run down before the<lb/>
               <pb n="079"/>  
wind more than two hours before the light-house began to<lb/>  
show itself, just rising out of the waves. This gave them<lb/>  
the advantage of a beacon, Mulford having steered hitherto<lb/>  
altogether by the sun, the direction of the wind, and the<lb/>  
treading of the reef. Now he had his port in sight, it <lb/>being his intention to take possession of the dwelling of the<lb/>  
light-house keeper, and to remain in it, until a favourable<lb/>  
opportunity occurred to remove Rose to Key West. The<lb/>  
young man had also another important project in view,<lb/>  
which it will be in season to mention as it reaches the <lb/>moment of its fulfillment.</p>
            <p>The rate of sailing of the light-house boat, running <lb/>before a brisk trade wind, could not be much less than nine<lb/>  
miles in the hour. About eleven o'clock, therefore, the<lb/>  
lively craft shot through one of the narrow channels of the<lb/>  
islets, and entered the haven. In a few minutes all three<lb/>  
of the adventurers were on the little wharf where the <lb/>light-house people were in the habit of landing. Rose proceeded<lb/>  
to the house, while Harry and Jack remained to secure the<lb/>  
boat. For the latter purpose a sort of slip, or little dock,<lb/>  
had been made, and when the boat was hauled into it, it<lb/>  
lay so snug that not only was the craft secure from injury,<lb/>  
but it was actually hid from the view of all but those who<lb/>   
stood directly above it.</p>
            <p>  
“This is a snug berth for the boat, Jack,” observed the<lb/>  
mate, when he had hauled it into the place mentioned,<lb/>  
“ and by unstepping the mast, a passer-by would not <lb/>suspect such a craft of lying in it. Who knows what <lb/>occasion there may be for concealment, and I'll e'en do that<lb/>  
thing.”</p>
            <p>To a casual listener, Harry, in unstepping the mast,<lb/>  
might have seemed influenced merely by a motiveless <lb/>impulse; but, in truth, a latent suspicion of Jack's intentions<lb/>  
instigated him, and as he laid the mast, sprit and sail on<lb/>  
the thwarts, he determined, in his own mind, to remove<lb/>  
them all to some other place, as soon as an opportunity for<lb/>  
doing so unobserved should occur. He and Jack now <lb/>followed Rose to the house.</p>
            <p>The islets were found deserted and tenantless. Not a<lb/>  
human being had entered the house since Rose left it, the<lb/>  
evening she had remained so long ashore, in company with<lb/>
               <pb n="080"/>  
her aunt and the Señor Montefalderon. This our heroine<lb/>  
knew from the circumstance of finding a slight fastening<lb/>  
of the outer door in the precise situation in which she had<lb/>  
left it with her own hands. At first a feeling of oppression<lb/>  
and awe prevailed with both Harry and Rose, when they<lb/>  
recollected the fate of those who had so lately been tenants<lb/>  
of the place; but this gradually wore off, and each soon got<lb/>  
to be more at home. As for Jack, he very coolly <lb/>rummaged the lockers, as he called the drawers and closets of<lb/>  
the place, and made his preparations for cooking a very <lb/>delicious repast, in which <hi rend="italics">callipash</hi> and <hi rend="italics">callipee</hi> were to be<lb/>  
material ingredients. The necessary condiments were<lb/>  
easily enough found in that place, turtle being a common<lb/>  
dish there, and it was not long before steams that might<lb/>  
have quickened the appetite of an alderman filled the<lb/>  
kitchen. Rose rummaged, too, and found a clean <lb/>tablecloth, plates, glasses, bowls, spoons, and knives; in a<lb/>  
word, all that was necessary to spread a plain but plentiful<lb/>  
board. While all this was doing, Harry took some <lb/>fishing-tackle, and proceeded to a favourable spot among the rocks.<lb/>  
In twenty minutes he returned with a fine mess of that<lb/>  
most delicious little fish that goes by the very unpoetical<lb/>  
name of “hog-fish,” from the circumstance of its giving a<lb/>  
grunt not unlike that of a living porker, when rudely drawn<lb/>  
from its proper element. Nothing was now wanting to<lb/>  
not only a comfortable, but to what was really a most <lb/>epicurian meal, and Jack just begged the lovers to have <lb/>patience for an hour or so, when he promised them dishes<lb/>  
that even New York could not furnish.</p>
            <p>Harry and Rose first retired to pay a little attention to<lb/>  
their dress, and then they joined each other in a walk.<lb/>  
The mate had found some razors, and was clean shaved.<lb/>  
He had also sequestered a shirt, and made some other little<lb/>  
additions to his attire, that contributed to give him the <lb/>appearance of being, that which he really was, a very <lb/>gentleman-like looking young sailor. Rose had felt no necessity<lb/>  
for taking liberties with the effects of others, though a good<lb/>  
deal of female attire was found in the dwelling. As was<lb/>  
afterward ascertained, a family ordinarily dwelt there, but<lb/>  
most of it had gone to Key West, on a visit, at the moment<lb/>  
when the man and boy left in charge had fallen into the<lb/>
               <pb n="081"/>  
hands of the Mexicans, losing their lives in the manner<lb/>  
mentioned.</p>
            <p>While walking together, Harry opened his mind to Rose,<lb/>  
on the subject which lay nearest to his heart, and which<lb/>  
had been at the bottom of this second visit to the islets of<lb/>  
the Dry Tortugas. During the different visits of Wallace<lb/>  
to the brig, the boat's crew of the Poughkeepsie had held<lb/>  
more or less discourse with the people of the Swash. This<lb/>  
usually happens on such occasions, and although Spike had<lb/>  
endeavoured to prevent it, when his brig lay in this bay,<lb/>  
he had not been entirely successful. Such discourse is<lb/>  
commonly jocular, and sometimes witty; every speech,<lb/>  
coming from which side it may, ordinarily commencing<lb/>  
with “shipmate,” though the interlocutors never saw each<lb/>  
other before that interview. In one of the visits an <lb/>allusion was made to cargo, when “the pretty gal aft,” was <lb/>mentioned as being a part of the cargo of the Swash. In answer<lb/>  
to this remark, the wit of the Poughkeepsie had told the<lb/>  
brig's man, “you had better send her on board us, <hi rend="italics">for we<lb/>  
carry a chaplain, a regular-built one, that will be a bishop<lb/>  
some day or other, perhaps,</hi> and we can get her spliced to<lb/>  
one of our young officers.” This remark had induced the<lb/>  
sailor of the Molly to ask if a sloop-of-war really carried<lb/>  
such a piece of marine luxury as a chaplain, and the <lb/>explanation given went to say that the clergyman in question<lb/>  
did not properly belong to the Poughkeepsie, but was to be<lb/>  
put on board a frigate, as soon as they fell in with one that<lb/>  
he named. Now, all this Mulford overheard, and he <lb/>remembered it at a moment when it might be of use. <lb/>Situated as he and Rose were, he felt the wisdom and propriety<lb/>  
of their being united, and his present object was to <lb/>persuade his companion to be of the same way of thinking.<lb/>  
He doubted not that the sloop-of-war would come in, ere<lb/>  
long, perhaps that very day, and he believed it would be an<lb/>  
easy matter to induce her chaplain to perform the <lb/>ceremony. America is a country in which every facility exists,<lb/>  
with the fewest possible impediments, to getting married;<lb/>  
and, we regret to be compelled to add, to getting <lb/>unmarried also. There are no banns, no licenses, no consent of<lb/>  
parents even, usually necessary, and persons who are of<lb/>  
the age of discretion, which, as respects females and <lb/>
               <pb n="082"/>matrimony, is a very tender age indeed, may be married, if they<lb/>  
see fit, almost without form or ceremony. There existed,<lb/>  
therefore, no legal impediment to the course Mulford <lb/>desired to take; and his principal, if not his only difficulty,<lb/>  
would be with Rose. Over her scruples he hoped to <lb/>prevail, and not without reason, as the case he could and did<lb/>  
present, was certainly one of a character that entitled him<lb/>  
to be heard with great attention.</p>
            <p>In the first place, Mrs. Budd had approved of the <lb/>connection, and it was understood between them, that the<lb/>  
young people were to be united at the first port in which a<lb/>  
clergyman of their own persuasion could be found, and<lb/>  
previously to reaching home. This had been the aunt's<lb/>  
own project, for, weak and silly as she was, the relict had<lb/>  
a woman's sense of the proprieties. It had occured to her<lb/>  
that it would be more respectable to make the long journey<lb/>  
which lay before them, escorted by a nephew and husband,<lb/>  
than escorted by even an accepted lover. It is true that<lb/>  
she had never anticipated a marriage in a light-house, and<lb/>  
under the circumstances in which Rose was now placed,<lb/>  
though it might be more reputable that her niece should<lb/>  
quit the islets as the wife of Harry than as his betrothed.<lb/>  
Then Mulford still apprehended Spike. In that remote<lb/>  
part of the world, almost beyond the confines of society, it<lb/>  
was not easy to foretell what claims he might set up, in the<lb/>  
event of his meeting them there. Armed with the <lb/>authority of a husband, Mulford could resist him, in any such<lb/>  
case, with far better prospects of success than if he should<lb/>  
appear only in the character of a suitor.</p>
            <p>Rose listened to these arguments, ardently and <lb/>somewhat eloquently put, as a girl of her years and habits would<lb/>  
be apt to listen to a favoured lover. She was much too<lb/>  
sincere to deny her own attachment, which the events of<lb/>  
the last few days had increased almost to intenseness, so<lb/>  
apt is our tenderness to augment in behalf of those for<lb/>  
whom we feel solicitude; and her judgment told her that<lb/>  
the more sober part of Harry's reasoning was entitled to<lb/>  
consideration. As his wife, her situation would certainly<lb/>  
be much less equivocal and awkward, than while she bore<lb/>  
a different name, and was admitted to be a single woman,<lb/>  
and it might yet be weeks before the duty she owed her<lb/>
               <pb n="083"/>  
aunt would allow her to proceed to the north. But, after<lb/>  
all, Harry prevailed more through the influence of his hold<lb/>  
on Rose's affections, as would have been the case with <lb/>almost every other woman, than through any force of <lb/>reasoning. He truly loved, and that made him eloquent when<lb/>  
he spoke of love; sympathy in all he uttered being his<lb/>  
great ally. When summoned to the house, by the call of<lb/>  
Jack, who announced that the turtle-soup was ready, they<lb/>  
returned with the understanding that the chaplain of the<lb/>  
Poughkeepsie should unite them, did the vessel come in,<lb/>  
and would the functionary mentioned consent to perform<lb/>  
the ceremony.</p>
            <p>“It would be awkward—nay, it would be distressing,<lb/>  
Harry, to have him refuse,” said the blushing Rose, as they<lb/>  
walked slowly back to the house, more desirous to prolong<lb/>  
their conversation than to partake of the bountiful provision<lb/>  
of Jack Tier. The latter could not but be acceptable,<lb/>  
nevertheless, to a young man like Mulford, who was in<lb/>  
robust health, and who had fared so badly for the last <lb/>eight-and-forty hours. When he sat down to the table, <lb/>therefore, which was covered by a snow-white cloth, with <lb/>smoking and most savoury viands on it, it will not be surprising<lb/>  
if we say it was with a pleasure that was derived from one<lb/>  
of the great necessities of our nature.</p>
            <p>Sancho calls for benediction “on the man who invented<lb/>  
sleep.” It would have been more just to have asked this<lb/>  
boon in behalf of him who invented eating and turtle-soup.<lb/>  
The wearied fall into sleep, as it might be unwittingly;<lb/>  
sometimes against their will, and often against their <lb/>interests; while many a man is hungry without possessing the<lb/>  
means of appeasing his appetite. Still more daily feel<lb/>  
hunger without possessing turtle-soup. Certain persons<lb/>  
impute this delicious compound to the genius of some <lb/>London alderman, but we rather think unjustly. Aldermanic<lb/>  
genius is easily excited and rendered active, no doubt, by<lb/>  
strong appeals on such a theme, but our own experience<lb/>  
inclines us to believe that the tropics usually send their <lb/>inventions to the less fruitful regions of the earth along<lb/>  
with their products. We have little doubt, could the fact<lb/>  
be now ascertained, that it would be found turtle-soup was<lb/>  
originally invented by just some such worthy as Jack Tier,<lb/>
               <pb n="084"/>  
who in filling his coppers to tickle the captain's appetite,<lb/>  
had used all the condiments within his reach; ventured on<lb/>  
a sort of Regent's punch; and, as the consequence, had<lb/>  
brought forth the dish so often eulogized, and so well <lb/>beloved. It is a little extraordinary that in Paris, the seat of<lb/>  
gastronomy, one rarely, if ever, hears of or sees this dish;<lb/>  
while in London it is to be met in almost as great <lb/>abundance as in one of our larger commercial towns. But so<lb/>  
it is, and we cannot say we much envy a <hi rend="italics">cuisine</hi> its <hi rend="italics">patés,  
 </hi>
               <lb/> and <hi rend="italics">soufflets,</hi> and its <hi rend="italics">à la</hi> this and <hi rend="italics">à la</hi> thats, but which<lb/>  
was never redolent with the odours of turtle-soup.</p>
            <p>“Upon my word, Jack, you have made out famously<lb/>  
with your dinner, or supper, whichever you may please<lb/>  
to call it,” cried Mulford gaily, as he took his seat at <lb/>table, after having furnished Rose with a chair. “Nothing<lb/>  
appears to be wanting; but here is good pilot bread, <lb/>potatoes even, and other little niceties, in addition to the turtle<lb/>  
and the fish. These good people of the light seem to have<lb/>  
lived comfortably, at any rate.”</p>
            <p>“Why should they not, maty?” answered Jack, <lb/>beginning to help to soup. “Living on one of these islets is<lb/>  
like living afloat. Everything is laid in, as for an outward<lb/>  
bound craft; then the reef must always furnish fish and<lb/>  
turtle. I've overhauled the lockers pretty thoroughly, and<lb/>  
find a plenty of stores to last <hi rend="italics">us</hi> a month. Tea, sugar,<lb/>  
coffee, bread, pickles, potatoes, onions, and all other <lb/>knick-knacks.”</p>
            <p>“The poor people who own these stores will be <lb/>heavy-hearted enough when they come to learn the reason why<lb/>  
we have been put in undisturbed possession of their <lb/>property,” said Rose. “We must contrive some means of<lb/>  
repaying them for such articles as we may use, Harry.”</p>
            <p>“That's easily enough done, Miss Rose. Drop one of<lb/>  
the half-eagles in a tea-pot, or a mug, and they'll be <lb/>certain to fall in with it when they come back. Nothin' is<lb/>  
easier than to pay a body's debts, when a body has the will<lb/>  
and the means. Now, the worst enemy of Stephen Spike<lb/>  
must own that his brig never quits port with unsettled bills.<lb/>  
Stephen has his faults, like other mortals; but he has his<lb/>  
good p'ints, too.”</p>
            <p>“Still praising Spike, my good Jack,” cried the mate,<lb/>
               <pb n="085"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
a little provoked at this pertinacity in the deputy-steward,<lb/>  
in sticking to his ship and his shipmate. “I should have<lb/>  
thought that you had sailed with him long enough to have<lb/>  
found him out, and to wish never to put your foot in his<lb/>  
cabin again.”</p>
            <p>“Why, no, maty, a craft is a craft, and a body gets to<lb/>  
like even the faults of one in which a body has gone through<lb/>  
gales, and squalls, with a whole skin. I like the Swash,<lb/>  
and, for sartain things I like her captain.”</p>
            <p>“Meaning by that, it is your intention to get on board<lb/>  
of the one, and to sail with the other, again, as soon as you<lb/>  
can.”</p>
            <p>“I do, Mr. Mulford, and make no bones in telling on't.<lb/>  
You know that I came here without wishing it.”</p>
            <p>“Well, Jack, no one will attempt to control your <lb/>movements, but you shall be left your own master. I feel it to<lb/>  
be a duty, however, as one who may know more of the law<lb/>  
than yourself, as well as more of Stephen Spike, to tell you<lb/>  
that he is engaged in a treasonable commerce with the <lb/>enemy, and that he, and all who voluntarily remain with him,<lb/>  
knowing this fact, may be made to swing for it.”</p>
            <p>“Then I'll swing for it,” returned Jack, sullenly.</p>
            <p>“There is a little obstinacy in this, my good fellow, and<lb/>  
you must be reasoned out of it. I am under infinite <lb/>obligations to you, Jack, and shall ever be ready to own them.<lb/>  
Without you to sail the boat, I might have been left to<lb/>  
perish on that rock,—for God only knows whether any<lb/>  
vessel would have seen me in passing. Most of those who<lb/>  
go through that passage keep the western side of the reef<lb/>  
aboard, they tell me, on account of there being better<lb/>  
water on that side of the channel, and the chance of a<lb/>  
man's being seen on a rock, by ships a league or two off,<lb/>  
would be small indeed. Yes, Jack, I owe my life to you,<lb/>  
and am proud to own it.”</p>
            <p>“You owe it to Miss Rose, maty, who put me up to the<lb/>  
enterprise, and who shared it with me.”</p>
            <p>“To her I owe more than life,” answered Harry, <lb/>looking at his beloved as she delighted in being regarded by<lb/>  
him, “but even she, with all her wishes to serve me, would<lb/>  
have been helpless without your skill in managing a boat.<lb/>  
I owe also to your good-nature the happiness of having<lb/>
               <pb n="086"/>  
Rose with me at this moment; for without you she would<lb/>  
not have come.”</p>
            <p>“I'll not deny it, maty—take another ladle-full of the<lb/>  
soup, Miss Rosy: a quart of it would n't hurt an infant—<lb/>  
I'll not deny it, Mr. Mulford—I know by the way you've<lb/>  
got rid of the first bowl-full that <hi rend="italics">you</hi> are ready for another,<lb/>  
and there it is—I'll not deny it, and all I can say is that<lb/>  
you are heartily welcome to my sarvices.”</p>
            <p>“I thank you, Jack; but all this only makes me more<lb/>  
desirous of being of use to you, now, when it's in my<lb/>  
power. I wish you to stick by me, and not to return to<lb/>  
the Swash. As soon as I get to New York I shall build<lb/>  
or buy a ship, and the berth of steward in her shall always<lb/>  
be open to you.”</p>
            <p>“Thank'e, maty; thank'e, with all my heart. It's<lb/>  
something to know that a port is open to leeward, and,<lb/>  
though I cannot <hi rend="italics">now</hi> accept your offer, the day <hi rend="italics">may</hi> come<lb/>  
when I shall be glad to do so.”</p>
            <p>“If you like living ashore better, our house will always<lb/>  
be ready to receive you. I should be glad to leave as<lb/>  
handy a little fellow as yourself behind me whenever I went<lb/>  
to sea. There are a hundred things in which you might<lb/>  
be useful, and fully earn your biscuit, so as to have no<lb/>  
qualms about eating the bread of idleness.”</p>
            <p>“Thank'e, thank'e, maty,” cried Jack, dashing a tear<lb/>  
out of his eye with the back of his hand, “thank'e, sir,<lb/>  
from the bottom of my heart. The time <hi rend="italics">may</hi> come, but<lb/>  
not now. My papers is signed for this v'y'ge. Stephen<lb/>  
Spike has a halter round his neck, as you say yourself, and<lb/>  
it's necessary for me to be there to look to't. We all<lb/>  
have our callin's and duties, and this is mine. I stick by<lb/>  
the Molly and her captain until both are out of this scrape,<lb/>  
or both are condemned. I know nothin' of treason; but<lb/>  
if the law wants another victim, I must take my chance.”</p>
            <p>Mulford was surprised at this steadiness of Jack's, in<lb/>  
what he thought a very bad cause, and he was quite as<lb/>  
much surprised that Rose did not join him, in his <lb/>endeavours to persuade the steward not to be so foolhardy, as to<lb/>  
endeavour to go back to the brig. Rose did not, however;<lb/>  
sitting silently eating her dinner the whole time, though<lb/>  
she occasionally cast glances of interest at both the <lb/>
               <pb n="087"/>speakers the while. In this state of things the mate abandoned<lb/>  
the attempt, for the moment, intending to return to the<lb/>  
subject, after having had a private conference with his <lb/>betrothed.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the little drawback just related, that<lb/>  
was a happy as well as a delicious repast. The mate did<lb/>  
full justice to the soup, and afterward to the fish with the<lb/>  
unpoetical name; and Rose ate more than she had done in<lb/>  
the last three days. The habits of discipline prevented<lb/>  
Jack from taking his seat at table, though pressed by both<lb/>  
Rose and Harry to do so, but he helped himself to the <lb/>contents of a bowl and did full justice to his own art, on one<lb/>  
aside. The little fellow was delighted with the praises<lb/>  
that were bestowed on his dishes; and for the moment, the<lb/>  
sea, its dangers, its tornadoes, wrecks and races, were all<lb/>  
forgotten in the security and pleasures of so savoury a<lb/>  
repast.</p>
            <p>“Folk ashore do n't know how sailors sometimes live,”<lb/>  
said Jack, holding a large spoon filled with the soup ready<lb/>  
to plunge into a tolerably capacious mouth.</p>
            <p>“Or how they sometimes starve,” answered Rose. “<lb/>Remember our own situation, less than forty-eight hours<lb/>  
since!”</p>
            <p>“All very true, Miss Rose; yet, you see, turtle-soup<lb/>  
brings us up, a'ter all. Would you like a glass of wine,<lb/>  
maty?”</p>
            <p>“Very much indeed, Jack, after so luscious a soup; but<lb/>  
wishing for it will not bring it here.”</p>
            <p>“That remains to be seen, sir. I call this a bottle of<lb/>  
something that looks wery much like a wine.”</p>
            <p>“Claret, as I live! Why, where should light-house<lb/>  
keepers get the taste for claret?”</p>
            <p>“I've thought of that myself, Mr. Mulford, and have<lb/>  
supposed that some of Uncle Sam's officers have brought<lb/>  
the liquor to this part of the world. I understand a party<lb/>  
on 'em was here surveyin' all last winter. It seems they<lb/>  
come in the cool weather, and get their sights and measure<lb/>  
their distances, and go home in the warm weather, and<lb/>  
work out their traverses in the shade, as it might be.”</p>
            <p>“This seems likely, Jack; but, come whence it may it<lb/>  
is welcome, and we will taste it.”</p>
            <pb n="088"/>
            <p/>
            <p>Mulford then drew the cork of this mild and grateful<lb/>  
liquor, and helped his companions and himself. In this<lb/>  
age of moral <hi rend="italics">tours de force,</hi> one scarcely dare say anything<lb/>  
favourable of a liquid that even bears the name of wine, or<lb/>  
extol the shape of a bottle. It is truly the era of <lb/>exaggeration. Nothing is treated in the old-fashioned, natural, <lb/>common sense way. Virtue is no longer virtue, unless it get<lb/>  
upon stilts; and, as for sin's being confined to “<lb/>transgression against the law of God,” audacious would be the<lb/>  
wretch who should presume to limit the sway of the <lb/>societies by any dogma so narrow! A man may be as <lb/>abstemious as an anchorite and get no credit for it, unless “he<lb/>  
sigu the pledge;” or, signing the pledge, he may get <lb/>fuddled in corners, and be cited as a miracle of sobriety. The<lb/>  
test of morals is no longer in the abuse of the gifts of <lb/>Providence, but in their use; prayers are deserting the closet<lb/>  
for the corners of streets, and charity (not the giving of<lb/>  
alms) has got to be so earnest in the demonstration of its<lb/>  
nature, as to be pretty certain to “begin at home,” and to<lb/>  
end where it begins. Even the art of mendacity has been<lb/>  
aroused by the great progress which is making by all around<lb/>  
it, and many manifest the strength of their ambition by<lb/>  
telling ten lies where their fathers would have been <lb/>satisfied with telling only one. This art has made an <lb/>extraordinary progress within the last quarter of a century, aspiring<lb/>  
to an ascendency that was formerly conceded only to truth,<lb/>  
until he who gains his daily bread by it has some such<lb/>  
contempt for the sneaking wretch who does business on<lb/>  
the small scale, as the slayer of his thousands in the field<lb/>  
is known to entertain for him who kills only a single man<lb/>  
in the course of a long life.</p>
            <p>At the risk of damaging the reputations of our hero and<lb/>  
heroine, we shall frankly aver the fact that both Harry and<lb/>  
Rose partook of the <hi rend="italics">vin de Bordeaux,</hi> a very respectable<lb/>  
bottle of <hi rend="italics">Medoc,</hi> by the way, which had been forgotten by<lb/>  
Uncle Sam's people, in the course of the preceding winter,<lb/>  
agreeably to Jack Tier's conjecture. One glass sufficed<lb/>  
for Rose, and, contrary as it may be to all modern theory,<lb/>  
she was somewhat the better for it; while the mate and<lb/>  
Jack Tier quite half emptied the bottle, being none the<lb/>  
worse. There they sat, enjoying the security and <lb/>
               <pb n="089"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>abundance which had succeeded to their late danger, happy in<lb/>  
that security, happy in themselves, and happy in the <lb/>prospects of a bright future. It was just as practicable for<lb/>  
them to remain at the Dry Tortugas, as it was for the <lb/>family which ordinarily dwelt at the light. The place was<lb/>  
amply supplied with everything that would be necessary<lb/>  
for their wants, for months to come, and Harry caused his<lb/>  
betrothed to blush, as he whispered to her, should the<lb/>  
chaplain arrive, he should delight in passing the honey-moon<lb/>  
where they then were.</p>
            <p>“I could tend the light,” he added, smiling, “which<lb/>  
would be not only an occupation, but a useful occupation;<lb/>  
you could read all those books from beginning to end, and<lb/>  
Jack could keep us suplied with fish. By the way, <lb/>master steward, are you in the humour for motion, so soon<lb/>  
after your hearty meal?”</p>
            <p>“Anything to be useful,” answered Jack, cheerfully.</p>
            <p>“Then do me the favour to go up into the lantern of the<lb/>  
light-house, and take a look for the sloop-of-war. If she's<lb/>  
in sight at all, you'll find her off here to the northward;<lb/>  
and while you are aloft you may as well make a sweep of<lb/>  
the whole horizon. There hangs the light-house keeper's<lb/>  
glass, which may help your eyes, by stepping into the <lb/>gallery outside of the lantern.”</p>
            <p>Jack willingly complied, taking the glass and <lb/>proceeding forthwith to the other building. Mulford had two <lb/>objects in view in giving this commission to the steward. He<lb/>  
really wished to ascertain what was the chance of seeing<lb/>  
the Poughkeepsie, in the neighbourhood of the islets, and<lb/>  
felt just that indisposition to move himself, that is apt to<lb/>  
come over one who has recently made a very bountiful<lb/>  
meal, while he also desired to have another private <lb/>conversation with Rose.</p>
            <p>A good portion of the time that Jack was gone, and he<lb/>  
stayed quite an hour in the lantern, our lovers conversed as<lb/>  
lovers are much inclined to converse; that is to say, of<lb/>  
themselves, their feelings, and their prospects. Mulford<lb/>  
told Rose of his hopes and fears, while he visited at the<lb/>  
house of her aunt, previously to sailing, and the manner in<lb/>  
which his suspicions had been first awakened in reference<lb/>  
to the intentions of Spike—intentions, so far as they were<lb/>
               <pb n="090"/>  
connected with an admiration of his old commander's niece,<lb/>  
and possibly in connection also with the little fortune she<lb/>  
was known to possess, but not in reference to the bold <lb/>project to which he had, in fact, resorted. No distrust of the<lb/>  
scheme finally put in practice had ever crossed the mind<lb/>  
of the young mate, until he received the unexpected order,<lb/>  
mentioned in our opening chapter, to prepare the brig for<lb/>  
the reception of Mrs. Budd and her party. Harry confessed<lb/>  
his jealousy of one youth whom he dreaded far more even<lb/>  
than he had ever dreaded Spike, and whose apparent favour<lb/>  
with Rose, and actual favour with her aunt, had given him<lb/>  
many a sleepless night.</p>
            <p>They next conversed of the future, which to them seemed<lb/>  
full of flowers. Various were the projects started, <lb/>discussed, and dismissed, between them, the last almost as<lb/>  
soon as proposed. On one thing they were of a mind, as soon<lb/>  
as proposed. Harry was to have a ship as quick as one<lb/>  
could be purchased by Rose's means, and the promised<lb/>  
bride laughingly consented to make one voyage to Europe<lb/>  
along with her husband.</p>
            <p>“I wonder, dear Rose, my poverty has never presented<lb/>  
any difficulties in the way of our union,” said Harry, <lb/>sensibly touched with the free way his betrothed disposed of<lb/>  
her own money in his behalf; “but neither you nor Mrs.<lb/>  
Budd has ever seemed to think of the difference there is<lb/>  
between us in this respect.”</p>
            <p>“What is the trifle I possess, Harry, set in the balance<lb/>  
against your worth? My aunt, as you say, has thought I<lb/>  
might even be the gainer by the exchange.”</p>
            <p>“I am sure I feel a thousand times indebted to Mrs.<lb/>  
Budd—”</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="italics">Aunt</hi> Budd. You must learn to say, ‘<hi rend="italics">my</hi> Aunt Budd,’<lb/>  
Mr. Henry Mulford, if you mean to live in peace with her<lb/>  
unworthy niece.”</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="italics">Aunt</hi> Budd, then,” returned Harry, laughing, for the<lb/>  
laugh came easily that evening; “Aunt Budd, if you wish<lb/>  
it, Rose. I can have no objection to call any relative of<lb/>  
yours, uncle or aunt.”</p>
            <p>“I think we are intimate enough, now, to ask you a<lb/>  
question or two, Harry, touching my aunt,” continued<lb/>  
Rose, looking stealthily over her shoulder, as if <lb/>
               <pb n="091"/>apprehensive of being overheard. “You know how fond she is of<lb/>  
speaking of the sea, and of indulging in nautical phrases?”</p>
            <p>“Any one must have observed that, Rose,” answered<lb/>  
the young man, gazing up at the wall, in order not to be<lb/>  
compelled to look the beautiful creature before him in the<lb/>  
eyes—“Mrs. Budd has very strong tastes that way.”</p>
            <p>“Now tell me, Harry—that is, answer me frankly—I<lb/>  
mean—she is not <hi rend="italics">always</hi> right, is she?”</p>
            <p>“Why, no; not absolutely so—that is, not absolutely<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">always</hi> so—few persons are <hi rend="italics">always</hi> right, you know.”</p>
            <p>Rose remained silent and embarrassed for a moment;<lb/>  
after which she pursued the discourse.</p>
            <p>“But aunty does not know as much of the sea and of<lb/>  
ships as she thinks she does?”</p>
            <p>“Perhaps not. We all overrate our own acquirements.<lb/>  
I dare say that even I am not as good a seaman as I fancy<lb/>  
myself to be.”</p>
            <p>“Even Spike admits that you are what he calls ‘a prime<lb/>  
seaman.’ But it is not easy for a woman to get a correct<lb/>  
knowledge of the use of all the strange, and sometimes <lb/>uncouth, terms that you sailors use.”</p>
            <p>“Certainly not, and for that reason I would rather you<lb/>  
should never attempt it, Rose. We rough sons of the<lb/>  
ocean would prefer to hear our wives make divers pretty<lb/>  
blunders, rather than to be swaggering about like so many<lb/>  
‘old salts.’ ”</p>
            <p>“Mr. Mulford! Does Aunt Budd swagger like an old<lb/>  
salt?”</p>
            <p>“Dearest Rose, I was not thinking of your aunt, but of<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">you</hi>. Of you, as you are, feminine, spirited, lovely alike<lb/>  
in form and character, and of you a graduate of the ocean,<lb/>  
and full of its language and ideas.”</p>
            <p>It was probable Rose was not displeased at this allusion<lb/>  
to herself, for a smile struggled around her pretty mouth,<lb/>  
and she did not look at all angry. After another short<lb/>  
pause, she resumed the discourse.</p>
            <p>“My aunt did not very clearly comprehend those <lb/>explanations of yours about the time of day, and the longitude,”<lb/>  
she said, “nor am I quite certain that I did myself.”</p>
            <p>“You understood them far better than Mrs. Budd, Rose.<lb/>  
Women are so little accustomed to <hi rend="italics">think</hi> on such subjects<lb/>
               <pb n="092"/>  
at all, that it is not surprising they sometimes get confused.<lb/>  
I do wish, however, that your aunt could be persuaded to<lb/>  
be more cautious in the presence of strangers, on the <lb/>subject of terms she does not understand.”</p>
            <p>“I feared it might be so, Harry,” answered Rose, in a<lb/>  
low voice, as if unwilling even he should know the full <lb/>extent of her thoughts on this subject; “but my aunt's heart<lb/>  
is most excellent, though she may make mistakes <lb/>occasionally, I owe her a great deal, if not absolutely my <lb/>education, certainly my health and comfort through childhood,<lb/>  
and more prudent, womanly advice than you may suppose,<lb/>  
perhaps, since I have left school. How she became the<lb/>  
dupe of Spike, indeed, is to me unaccountable; for in all<lb/>  
that relates to health, she is, in general, both acute and<lb/>  
skilful.”</p>
            <p>“Spike is a man of more art than he appears to be to<lb/>  
superficial observers. On my first acquaintance with him,<lb/>  
I mistook him for a frank, fearless but well-meaning sailor,<lb/>  
who loved hazardous voyages and desperate speculation—<lb/>  
a sort of innocent gambler; but I have learned to know<lb/>  
better. His means are pretty much reduced to his brig,<lb/>  
and she is getting old, and can do but little more service.<lb/>  
His projects are plain enough, now. By getting you into<lb/>  
his power, he hoped to compel a marriage, in which case<lb/>  
both your fortune and your aunt's would contribute to <lb/>repair his.”</p>
            <p>“He might have killed me, but I never would have <lb/>married him,” rejoined Rose, firmly. “Is not that Jack <lb/>coming down the steps of the light-house?”</p>
            <p>“It is. I find that fellow's attachment to Spike very<lb/>  
extraordinary, Rose. Can you, in any manner, account<lb/>  
for it?”</p>
            <p>Rose at first seemed disposed to reply. Her lips parted,<lb/>  
as if about to speak, and closed again, as glancing her eyes<lb/>  
toward the open door, she seemed to expect the appearance<lb/>  
of the steward's little, rotund form on its threshold, which<lb/>  
held her tongue-tied. A brief interval elapsed, however,<lb/>  
ere Jack actually arrived, and Rose, perceiving that Harry<lb/>  
was curiously expecting her answer, said hurriedly—“It<lb/>  
may be hatred, not attachment.”</p>
            <p>The next instant Jack Tier entered the room. He had<lb/>
               <pb n="093"/>  
been gone rather more than an hour, not returning until<lb/>  
just as the sun was about to set in a flame of fire.</p>
            <p>“Well, Jack, what news from the Poughkeepsie?” <lb/>demanded the mate. “You have been gone long enough to<lb/>  
make sure of your errand. Is it certain that we are not<lb/>  
to see the man-of-war's-men to-night.”</p>
            <p>“Whatever you see, my advice to you is to keep close,<lb/>  
and to be on your guard,” answered Jack, evasively.</p>
            <p>“I have little fear of any of Uncle Sam's craft. A plain<lb/>  
story, and an honest heart, will make all clear to a <lb/>well-disposed listener. We have not been accomplices in<lb/>  
Spike's treasons, and cannot be made to answer for them.”</p>
            <p>“Take my advice, maty, and be in no hurry to hail<lb/>  
every vessel you see. Uncle Sam's fellows may not always<lb/>  
be at hand to help you. Do you not know that this island<lb/>  
will be tabooed to seamen for some time to come?”</p>
            <p>“Why so, Jack? The islet has done no harm, though<lb/>  
others may have performed wicked deeds near it.”</p>
            <p>“Two of the drowned men lie within a hundred yards<lb/>  
of this spot, and sailors never go near new-made graves, if<lb/>  
they can find any other place to resort to.”</p>
            <p>“You deal in enigmas, Jack; and did I not know that<lb/>  
you are very temperate, I might suspect that the time you<lb/>  
have been gone has been passed in the company of a bottle<lb/>  
of brandy.”</p>
            <p>“That will explain my meanin',” said Jack, laconically,<lb/>  
pointing as he spoke seemingly at some object that was to<lb/>  
be seen without.</p>
            <p>The door of the house was wide open, for the admission<lb/>  
of air. It faced the haven of the islets, and just as the<lb/>  
mate's eyes were turned to it, the end of a flying-jib-boom,<lb/>  
with the sail down, and fluttering beneath it, was coming<lb/>  
into the view. “The Poughkeepsie!” exclaimed Mulford,<lb/>  
in delight, seeing all his hopes realized, while Rose <lb/>blushed to the eyes. A pause succeeded, during which Mulford<lb/>  
drew aside, keeping his betrothed in the back-ground, and<lb/>  
as much out of sight as possible. The vessel was shooting<lb/>  
swiftly into view, and presently all there could see it was<lb/>  
the Swash.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">A moment</hi> of appalled surprise succeeded the instant<lb/>  
when Harry and Rose first ascertained the real character<lb/>  
of the vessel that had entered the haven of the Dry <lb/>Tortugas. Then the first turned toward Jack Tier, and sternly<lb/>  
demanded an explanation of his apparent faithlessness.</p>
            <p>“Rascal,” he cried, “has this treachery been intended?<lb/>  
Did you not see the brig and know her?”</p>
            <p>“Hush, Harry—<hi rend="italics">dear</hi> Harry,” exclaimed Rose, <lb/>entreatingly. “My life for it, Jack has <hi rend="italics">not</hi> been faithless.”</p>
            <p>“Why, then, has he not let us know that the brig was<lb/>  
coming? For more than an hour has he been aloft, on<lb/>  
the look-out, and here are we taken quite by surprise.<lb/>  
Rely on it, Rose, he has seen the approach of the brig, and<lb/>  
might have sooner put us on our guard.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, lay it on, maty,” said Jack, coolly, neither<lb/>  
angry nor mortified, so far as appearances went, at these<lb/>  
expressions of dissatisfaction; “my back is used to it. If<lb/>  
I did n't know what it is to get hard raps on the knuckles,<lb/>  
I should be but a young steward. But, as for this <lb/>business, a little reflection will tell you I am not to blame.”</p>
            <p>“Give us your own explanations, for without them I<lb/>  
shall trust you no longer.”</p>
            <p>“Well, sir, what good would it have done, <hi rend="italics">had</hi> I told<lb/>  
you the brig was standing for this place? There she came<lb/>  
down, like a race-horse, and escape for you was impossible.<lb/>  
As the wind is now blowin', the Molly would go two feet<lb/>  
to the boat's one, and a chase would have been madness.”</p>
            <p>“I do n't know that, sirrah” answered the mate.“ The<lb/>
               <pb n="095"/>  
boat might have got into the smaller passages of the reef,<lb/>  
where the brig could not enter, or she might have dodged<lb/>  
about among these islets, until it was night, and then <lb/>escaped in the darkness.”</p>
            <p>“I thought of all that, Mr. Mulford, but it came too late.<lb/>  
When I first went aloft, I came out on the north-west side<lb/>  
of the lantern, and took my seat, to look out for the <lb/>sloop-of-war, as you bade me, sir. Well, there I was sweepin'<lb/>  
the horizon with the glass for the better part of an hour,<lb/>  
sometimes fancyin' I saw her, and then givin' it up; for to<lb/>  
this moment I am not sartain there is n't a sail off here to<lb/>  
the westward, turning up toward the light on a bowline;<lb/>  
but if there be, she's too far off to know anything <lb/>partic'lar about her. Well, sir, there I sat, looking for the<lb/>  
Poughkeepsie, for the better part of an hour, when I<lb/>  
thought I would go round on t' other side of the lantern<lb/>  
and take a look to windward. My heart was in my mouth,<lb/>  
I can tell you, Miss Rose, when I saw the brig; and I felt<lb/>  
both glad and sorry. Glad on my own account, and sorry<lb/>  
on your'n. There she was, however, and no help for it,<lb/>  
within two miles of this very spot, and coming down as if<lb/>  
she despised touching the water at all. Now, what could<lb/>  
I do? There was n't time, Mr. Mulford, to get the boat<lb/>  
out, and the mast stepped, afore we should have been <lb/>within reach of canister, and Stephen Spike would not have<lb/>  
spared <hi rend="italics">that,</hi> in order to get you again within his power.”</p>
            <p>“Depend on it, Harry, this is all true,” said Rose, <lb/>earnestly. “I know Jack well, and can answer for his <lb/>fidelity. He wishes to, and if he can he <hi rend="italics">will</hi> return to the brig,<lb/>  
whither he thinks his duty calls him, but he will never<lb/>  
willingly betray <hi rend="italics">us</hi>—least of all, <hi rend="italics">me</hi>. Do I speak as I ought,<lb/>  
Jack?”</p>
            <p>“Gospel truth, Miss Rose, and Mr. Mulford will get<lb/>  
over this squall, as soon as he comes to think of matters as<lb/>  
he ought. There 's my hand, maty, to show I bear no<lb/>  
malice.”</p>
            <p>“I take it, Jack, for I must believe you honest, after all<lb/>  
you have done for us. Excuse my warmth, which, if a <lb/>little unreasonable, was somewhat natural under the <lb/>circumstances. I suppose our case is now hopeless, and that we<lb/>  
shall all be soon on board the brig again; for Spike will<lb/>
               <pb n="096"/>  
hardly think of abandoning me again on an island <lb/>provisioned and fitted as is this!”</p>
            <p>“It's not so sartain, sir, that you fall into his hands at<lb/>  
all,” put in Jack. “The men of the brig will never come<lb/>  
here of their own accord, depend on that, for sailors don't<lb/>  
like graves. Spike has come in here a'ter the schooner's<lb/>  
chain, that he dropped into the water when he made sail<lb/>  
from the sloop-of-war, at the time he was here afore, and<lb/>  
is not expectin' to find us here. No—no—he thinks we<lb/>  
are beatin' up toward Key West this very minute, if, <lb/>indeed, he has missed us at all. 'T is possible he believes<lb/>  
the boat has got adrift by accident, and has no thought of<lb/>  
our bein' out of the brig.”</p>
            <p>“That is impossible, Jack. Do you suppose he is <lb/>ignorant that Rose is missing?”</p>
            <p>“Sartain of it, maty, if Mrs. Budd has read the letter<lb/>  
well that Miss Rose left for her, and Biddy has obeyed <lb/>orders. If they've followed instructions, Miss Rose is<lb/>  
thought to be in her state-room, mournin' for a young man<lb/>  
who was abandoned on a naked rock, and Jack Tier, havin'<lb/>  
eat somethin' that has disagreed with him, is in his berth.<lb/>  
Recollect, Spike will not be apt to look into Miss Rose's<lb/>  
state-room or my berth, to see if all this is true. The<lb/>  
cook and Josh are both in my secret, and know I mean to<lb/>  
come back, and when the fit is over I have only to return<lb/>  
to duty, like any other hand. It is my calculation that<lb/>  
Spike believes both Miss Rose and myself on board the<lb/>  
Molly at this very moment.”</p>
            <p>“And the boat—what can he suppose has become of the<lb/>  
boat?”</p>
            <p>“Sartainly, the boat makes the only chance ag'in us.<lb/>  
But the boat was ridin' by its painter astarn, and accidents<lb/>  
sometimes happen to such craft. Then we two are the<lb/>  
wery last he will suspect of havin' made off in the boat by<lb/>  
ourselves. There'll be Mrs. Budd and Biddy as a sort of<lb/>  
pledge that Miss Rose is aboard, and as for Jack Tier, he<lb/>  
is too insignificant to occupy the captain's thoughts just<lb/>  
now. He will probably muster the people for'ard, when<lb/>  
he finds the boat is gone, but I do not think he'll trouble<lb/>  
the cabins or state-rooms.”</p>
            <p>Mulford admitted that this was <hi rend="italics">possible,</hi> though it<lb/>
               <pb n="097"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
scarcely seemed probable to him. There was no help,<lb/>  
however, for the actual state of things, and they all now<lb/>  
turned their attention to the brig, and to the movements<lb/>  
of those on board her. Jack Tier had swung-to the <lb/>outer-door of the house, as soon as the Swash came in view<lb/>  
through it, and fortunately none of the windows on that<lb/>  
side of the building had been opened at all. The air <lb/>entered to windward, which was on the rear of the dwelling,<lb/>  
so that it was possible to be comfortable and yet leave the<lb/>  
front, in view from the vessel, with its deserted air. As<lb/>  
for the brig, she had already anchored and got both her<lb/>  
boats into the water. The yawl was hauled alongside, in<lb/>  
readiness for any service that might be required of it, while<lb/>  
the launch had been manned at once, and was already<lb/>  
weighing the anchor, and securing the chain to which Tier<lb/>  
had alluded. All this served very much to lessen the <lb/>uneasiness of Mulford and Rose, as it went far to prove that<lb/>  
Spike had not come to the Dry Tortugas in quest of them,<lb/>  
as, at first, both had very naturally supposed. It might,<lb/>  
indeed, turn out that his sole object was to obtain this <lb/>anchor and chain, with a view to use them in raising the <lb/>ill-fated vessel that had now twice gone to the bottom.</p>
            <p>“I wish an explanation with you, Jack, on one other<lb/>  
point,” said the mate, after all three had been for sometime<lb/>  
observing the movements on board and around the Swash.<lb/>  
“Do you actually intend to get on board the brig?”</p>
            <p>“If it's to be done, maty. My v'y'ge is up with you<lb/>  
and Miss Rose. I may be said to have shipped for Key<lb/>  
West and a market, and the market's found at this port.”</p>
            <p>“You will hardly leave us <hi rend="italics">yet,</hi> Jack,” said Rose, with a<lb/>  
manner and emphasis that did not fail to strike her <lb/>betrothed lover, though he could in no way account for either.<lb/>  
That Rose should not wish to be left alone with him in<lb/>  
that solitary place was natural enough; or, might rather<lb/>  
be referred to education and the peculiar notions of her<lb/>  
sex; but he could not understand why so much importance<lb/>  
should be attached to the presence of a being of Jack Tier's<lb/>  
mould and character. It was true, that there was little<lb/>  
choice, under present circumstances, but it occurred to<lb/>  
Mulford that Rose had manifested the same strange <lb/>predilection when there might have been something nearer to a<lb/>
               <pb n="098"/>  
selection. The moment, however, was not one for much<lb/>  
reflection on the subject.</p>
            <p>“You will hardly leave us yet, Jack?” said Rose, in<lb/>  
the manner related.</p>
            <p>“it's now or never, Miss Rose. If the brig once gets<lb/>  
away from this anchorage without me, I may never lay eyes<lb/>  
on her ag'in. Her time is nearly up, for wood and iron<lb/>  
wont hold together always, any more than flesh and blood.<lb/>  
Consider how many years I've been busy in huntin' her<lb/>  
up, and how hard 't will be to lose that which has given<lb/>  
me so many weary days and sleepless nights to find.”</p>
            <p>Rose said no more. If not convinced, she was evidently<lb/>  
silenced, while Harry was left to wonder and surmise, as<lb/>  
best he might. Both quitted the subject, to watch the<lb/>  
people of the brig. By this time the anchor had been <lb/>lifted, and the chain was heaving in on board the vessel, by<lb/>  
means of a line that had been got around its bight. The<lb/>  
work went on rapidly, and Mulford observed to Rose that<lb/>  
he did not think it was the intention of Spike to remain<lb/>  
long at the Tortugas, inasmuch as his brig was riding by<lb/>  
a very short range of cable. This opinion was confirmed,<lb/>  
half an hour later, when it was seen that the launch was<lb/>  
hooked on and hoisted in again, as soon as the chain and<lb/>  
anchor of the schooner were secured.</p>
            <p>Jack Tier watched every movement with palpable <lb/>uneasiness. His apprehensions that Spike would obtain all he<lb/>  
wanted, and be off before he could rejoin him, increased<lb/>  
at each instant, and he did not scruple to announce an <lb/>intention to take the boat and go alongside of the Swash at<lb/>  
every hazard, rather than be left.</p>
            <p>“You do not reflect on what you say, Jack,” answered<lb/>  
Harry; “unless, indeed, it be your intention to betray us.<lb/>  
How could you appear in the boat, at this place, without<lb/>  
letting it be known that we must be hard by?”</p>
            <p>“That don't follow at all, maty,” answered Jack.<lb/>  
“Suppose I go alongside the brig and own to the captain<lb/>  
that I took the boat last night, with the hope of findin' you,<lb/>  
and that failin' to succeed, I bore up for this port, to look<lb/>  
for provisions and water. Miss Rose he thinks on board<lb/>  
at this moment, and in my judgment he would take me at<lb/>  
my word, give me a good cursing, and think no more about<lb/>  
it.”</p>
            <pb n="099"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“It would never do, Jack,” interposed Rose, instantly.<lb/>  
“It would cause the destruction of Harry, as Spike would<lb/>  
not believe you had not found him, without an examination<lb/>  
of this house.”</p>
            <p>“What are they about with the yawl, Mr. Mulford?”<lb/>  
asked Jack, whose eye was never off the vessel for a single<lb/>  
moment. “It's gettin' to be so dark that one can hardly<lb/>  
see the boat, but it seems as if they're about to man the<lb/>  
yawl.”</p>
            <p>“They are, and there goes a lantern into it. And that<lb/>  
is Spike himself coming down the brig's side this instant.”</p>
            <p>“They can only bring a lantern to search this house,”<lb/>  
exclaimed Rose. “Oh! Harry, you are lost!”</p>
            <p>“I rather think the lantern is for the light-house,” <lb/>answered Mulford, whose coolness, at what was certainly a<lb/>  
most trying moment, did not desert him. “Spike may<lb/>  
wish to keep the light burning, for once before, you will<lb/>  
remember, he had it kindled after the keeper was removed.<lb/>  
As for his sailing, he would not be apt to sail until the<lb/>  
moon rises; and in beating back to the wreck the light<lb/>  
may serve to let him know the bearings and position of the<lb/>  
reef.”</p>
            <p>“There they come,” whispered Rose, half breathless<lb/>  
with alarm. “The boat has left the brig, and is coming<lb/>  
directly hither!”</p>
            <p>All this was true enough. The yawl had shoved off,<lb/>  
and with two men to row it, was pulling for the wharf in<lb/>  
front of the house, and among the timbers of which lay the<lb/>  
boat, pretty well concealed beneath a sort of bridge. <lb/>Mulford would not retreat, though he looked to the fastenings<lb/>  
of the door as a means of increasing his chances of defence.<lb/>  
In the stern-sheets of the boat sat two men, though it was<lb/>  
not easy to ascertain who they were by the fading light.<lb/>  
One was known to be Spike, however, and the other, it<lb/>  
was conjectured, must be Don Juan Montefalderon, from the<lb/>  
circumstance of his being in the place of honour. Three<lb/>  
minutes solved this question, the boat reaching the wharf<lb/>  
by that time. It was instantly secured, and all four of the<lb/>  
men left it. Spike was now plainly to be discerned by<lb/>  
means of the lantern which he carried in his own hands,<lb/>  
He gave some orders, in his customary authoritative way,<lb/>
               <pb n="100"/>  
and in a high key, after which he led the way from the<lb/>  
wharf, walking side by side with the Señor Montefalderon.<lb/>  
These two last came up within a yard of the door of the<lb/>  
house, where they paused, enabling those within not only<lb/>  
to see their persons and the working of their countenances,<lb/>  
but to hear all that was said; this last the more especially,<lb/>  
since Spike never thought it necessary to keep his <lb/>powerful voice within moderate limits.</p>
            <p>“It's hardly worth while, Don Wan, for you to go into<lb/>  
the light-house,” said Spike. “'T is but a greasy, dirty<lb/>  
place at the best, and one's clothes are never the better for<lb/>  
dealin' with ile. Here, Bill, take the lantern, and get a<lb/>  
filled can, that we may go up and trim and fill the lamp,<lb/>  
and make a blaze. Bear a hand, lads, and I'll be a'ter<lb/>  
ye afore you reach the lantern. Be careful with the flame<lb/>  
about the ile, for seamen ought never to wish to see a <lb/>light-house destroyed.”</p>
            <p>“What do you expect to gain by lighting the lamps<lb/>  
above, Don Esteban?” demanded the Mexican, when the<lb/>  
sailors had disappeared in the light-house, taking their own<lb/>  
lantern with them.</p>
            <p>“It's wisest to keep things reg'lar about this spot, Don<lb/>  
Wan, which will prevent unnecessary suspicions. But, as<lb/>  
the brig stretches in toward the reef to-night, on our way<lb/>  
back, the light will be a great assistance. I am short of<lb/>  
officers, you know, and want all the help of this sort I can<lb/>  
get.”</p>
            <p>“To be sincere with you, Don Esteban, I greatly regret<lb/>  
you <hi rend="italics">are</hi> so short of officers, and do not yet despair of <lb/>inducing you to go and take off the mate, whom I hear you<lb/>  
have left on a barren rock. He was a fine young fellow,<lb/>  
Señor Spike, and the deed was not one that you will wish<lb/>  
to remember a few years hence.”</p>
            <p>“The fellow run, and I took him at his word, Don Wan.<lb/>  
I'm not obliged to receive back a deserter unless it suits<lb/>  
me.”</p>
            <p>“We are all obliged to see we do not cause a fellow<lb/>  
creature the loss of life. This will prove the death of the<lb/>  
charming young woman who is so much attached to him,<lb/>  
unless you relent and are merciful!”</p>
            <p>“Women have tender looks but tough hearts,” answered<lb/>
               <pb n="101"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
Spike, carelessly, though Mulford felt certain, by the tone<lb/>  
of his voice, that great bitterness of feeling lay smothered<lb/>  
beneath the affected indifference of his manner; “few die<lb/>  
of love.”</p>
            <p>“The young lady has not been on deck all day; and the<lb/>  
Irish woman tells me that she does nothing but drink water<lb/>  
—the certain proof of a high fever.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, she keeps her room if you will, Don Wan, but<lb/>  
she is not about to make a dupe of me by any such tricks.<lb/>  
I must go and look to the lamps, however, and you will<lb/>  
find the graves you seek in the rear of this house, about<lb/>  
thirty yards behind it, you'll remember. That's a very<lb/>  
pretty cross you've made, señor, and the skipper of the<lb/>  
schooner's soul will be all the better for settin' it up at the<lb/>  
head of his grave.”</p>
            <p>“It will serve to let those who come after us know that<lb/>  
a Christian sleeps beneath the sand, Don Esteban,” <lb/>answered the Mexican, mildly. “I have no other <lb/>expectation from this sacred symbol.”</p>
            <p>The two now separated, Spike going into the light-house,<lb/>  
little in a hurry, while Don Juan Montefalderon walked<lb/>  
round the building to its rear in quest of the grave. <lb/>Mulford waited a moment for Spike to get a short distance up<lb/>  
the stairs of the high tower he had to ascend, when placing<lb/>  
the arm of Rose within his own, he opened the door in<lb/>  
the rear of the house, and walked boldly toward the <lb/>Mexican. Don Juan was actually forcing the pointed end of<lb/>  
his little cross into the sand, at the head of his <lb/>countryman's grave, when Mulford and his trembling companion<lb/>  
reached the spot. Although night had shut in, it was not<lb/>  
so dark that persons could not be recognised at small <lb/>distances. The Señor Montefalderon was startled at an <lb/>apparition so sudden and unexpected, when Mulford saluted<lb/>  
him by name; but recognising first the voice of Harry,<lb/>  
and then the persons of himself and his companion, <lb/>surprise, rather than alarm, became the emotion that was <lb/>uppermost. Notwithstanding the strength of the first of these<lb/>  
feelings, he instantly saluted the young couple with the<lb/>  
polished ease that marked his manner, which had much of<lb/>  
the courtesy of a Castilian in it, tempered a little, perhaps,<lb/>  
by the greater flexibility of a Southern American.</p>
            <pb n="102"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“I <hi rend="italics">see</hi> you,” exclaimed Don Juan, “and must believe<lb/>  
my eyes. Without their evidence, however, I could scarce<lb/>  
believe it can be you two, one of whom I thought on board<lb/>  
the brig, and the other suffering a most miserable death on<lb/>  
a naked rock.”</p>
            <p>“I am aware of your kind feelings in our behalf, Don<lb/>  
Juan,” said Mulford, “and it is the reason I now confide<lb/>  
in you. I was taken off that rock by means of the boat,<lb/>  
which you doubtless have missed; and this is the gentle<lb/>  
being who has been the means of saving my life. To her<lb/>  
and Jack Tier, who is yonder, under the shadows of the<lb/>  
house, I owe my not being the victim of Spike's cruelty.”</p>
            <p>“I now comprehend the whole matter,  
Don Henrique.<lb/>  
Jack Tier has managed the boat for the señorita; and<lb/>  
those whom we were told were too ill to be seen on deck,<lb/>  
have been really out of the brig!”</p>
            <p>“Such are the facts, señor, and from <hi rend="italics">you</hi> there is no<lb/>  
wish to conceal them. We are then to understand that<lb/>  
the absence of Rose and Jack from the brig is not known<lb/>  
to Spike.”</p>
            <p>“I believe not, señor. He has alluded to both, once or<lb/>  
twice to-day, as being ill below; but would you not do<lb/>  
well to retire within the shade of the dwelling, lest a glance<lb/>  
from the lantern might let those in it know that I am not<lb/>  
alone.”</p>
            <p>“There is little danger, Don Juan, as they who stand<lb/>  
near a light cannot well see those who are in the darkness.<lb/>  
Beside, they are high in the air, while we are on the<lb/>  
ground, which will greatly add to the obscurity down here.<lb/>  
We can retire, nevertheless, as I have a few questions to<lb/>  
ask, which may as well be put in perfect security, as put<lb/>  
where there is any risk.”</p>
            <p>The three now drew near the house, Rose actually <lb/>stepping within its door, though Harry remained on its <lb/>exterior, in order to watch the proceedings of those in the<lb/>  
light-house. Here the Señor Montefalderon entered into<lb/>  
a more detailed explanation of what had occurred on board<lb/>  
the brig, since the appearance of day, that very morning.<lb/>  
According to his account of the matter, Spike had <lb/>immediately called upon the people to explain the loss of the<lb/>  
boat. Tier was not interrogated on this occasion, it being<lb/>
               <pb n="103"/>  
understood he had gone below and turned in, after having<lb/>  
the look-out for fully half the night. As no one could, or<lb/>  
would, give an account of the manner in which the boat<lb/>  
was missing, Josh was ordered to go below and question<lb/>  
Jack on the subject. Whether it was from consciousness<lb/>  
of his connection with the escape of Jack, and <lb/>apprehensions of the consequences, or from innate good-nature, and<lb/>  
a desire to befriend the lovers, this black now admitted<lb/>  
that Jack confessed to him that the boat had got away from<lb/>  
him while endeavouring to shift the turns of its painter from<lb/>  
a cleet where they ought not to be, to their proper place.<lb/>  
This occurred early in Jack's watch, according to Josh's<lb/>  
story, and had not been reported, as the boat did not <lb/>properly belong to the brig, and was an incumbrance rather<lb/>  
than an advantage. The mate admired the negro's <lb/>cunning, as Don Juan related this part of his story, which put<lb/>  
him in a situation to throw all the blame on Jack's <lb/>mendacity in the event of a discovery, while it had the effect to<lb/>  
allow the fugitives more time for their escape. The result<lb/>  
was, that Spike bestowed a few hearty curses, as usual, on<lb/>  
the clumsiness of Jack Tier, and seemed to forget all about<lb/>  
the matter. It is probable he connected Jack's abstaining<lb/>  
from showing himself on deck, and his alleged <lb/>indisposition, with his supposed delinquency in this matter of the<lb/>  
boat. From that moment the captain appeared to give<lb/>  
himself no further concern on the subject, the boat having<lb/>  
been, in truth, an incumbrance rather than a benefit, as<lb/>  
stated.</p>
            <p>“As for Rose, her keeping her room, under the <lb/>circumstances, was so very natural, that the Señor Montefalderon<lb/>  
had been completely deceived, as, from his tranquillity on<lb/>  
this point, there was no question was the case with Spike<lb/>  
also. Biddy appeared on deck, though the widow did not,<lb/>  
and the Irish woman shook her head anxiously when <lb/>questioned about her young mistress, giving the spectators <lb/>reason to suppose that the latter was in a very bad way.</p>
            <p>As respects the brig and her movements, Spike had got<lb/>  
under way as soon as there was light enough to find his<lb/>  
course, and had run through the passage. It is probable<lb/>  
that the boat was seen; for something that was taken for<lb/>  
a small sail had just been made out for a single instant, and<lb/>
               <pb n="104"/>  
then became lost again. This little sail was made, if made<lb/>  
at all, in the direction of the Dry Tortugas, but so <lb/>completely was all suspicion at rest in the minds of those on<lb/>  
the quarter-deck of the Swash, that neither Spike nor the<lb/>  
Mexican had the least idea what it was. When the <lb/>circumstance was reported to the former, he answered that it<lb/>  
was probably some small wrecker, of which many were<lb/>  
hovering about the reef, and added, laughingly, though in<lb/>  
a way to prove how little he thought seriously on the <lb/>subject at all, “who knows but the light-house boat has fallen<lb/>  
into their hands, and that they've made sail on <hi rend="italics">her;</hi> if<lb/>  
they have, my word for it, that she goes, hull, spars, rigging,<lb/>  
canvas, and cargo, all in a lump, for salvage.”</p>
            <p>As the brig came out of the passage, in broad day, the<lb/>  
heads of the schooner's masts were seen, as a matter of<lb/>  
course. This induced Spike to heave-to, lower a boat, and<lb/>  
to go in person to examine the condition of the wreck.<lb/>  
It will be seen that Jack's presence could now be all the <lb/>better dispensed with. The examination, with the soundings,<lb/>  
and other calculations connected with raising the vessel,<lb/>  
occupied hours. When they were completed, Spike <lb/>returned on board, run up his boat, and squared away for the<lb/>  
Dry Tortugas. Señor Montefalderon confirmed the justice<lb/>  
of Jack Tier's surmises, as to the object of this <lb/>unexpected visit. The brig had come solely for the chain and <lb/>anchor mentioned, and having secured them, it was Spike's<lb/>  
intention to get under way and beat up to the wreck again<lb/>  
as soon as the moon rose. As for the sloop-of-war, he <lb/>believed she had given him up; for by this time she must<lb/>  
know that she had no chance with the brig, so long as the<lb/>  
latter kept near the reef, and that she ran the constant<lb/>  
hazard of shipwreck, while playing so near the dangers<lb/>  
herself.</p>
            <p>Before the Señor Montefalderon exhausted all he had to<lb/>  
communicate, he was interrupted by Jack Tier with a <lb/>singular proposition. Jack's great desire was to get on board<lb/>  
the Swash; and he now begged the Mexican to let Mulford<lb/>  
take the yawl and scull him off to the brig, and return to<lb/>  
the islet before Spike and his companions should descend<lb/>  
from the lantern of the light-house. The little fellow <lb/>insisted there was sufficient time for such a purpose, as the<lb/>
               <pb n="105"/>  
three in the lantern had not yet succeeded in filling the<lb/>  
lamps with the oil necessary to their burning for a night—<lb/>  
a duty that usually occupied the regular keeper for an hour.<lb/>  
Five or six minutes would suffice for him; and if he were<lb/>  
seen going up the brig's side, it would be easy for him to<lb/>  
maintain that he had come ashore in the boat. No one<lb/>  
took such precise note of what was going on; as to be able<lb/>  
to contradict him; and as to Spike and the men with him,<lb/>  
they would probably never hear anything about it.</p>
            <p>Don Juan Montefalderon was struck with the boldness<lb/>  
of Jack Tier's plan, but refused his assent to it. He <lb/>deemed it too hazardous, but substituted a project of his own.<lb/>  
The moon would not rise until near eleven, and it wanted<lb/>  
several hours before the time of sailing. When they <lb/>returned to the brig, he would procure his cloak, and scull<lb/>  
himself ashore, being perfectly used to managing a boat in<lb/>  
this way, under the pretence of wishing to pass an hour<lb/>  
longer near the grave of his countryman. At the <lb/>expiration of that hour he would take Jack off, concealed beneath<lb/>  
his cloak—an exploit of no great difficulty in the darkness,<lb/>  
especially as no one would be on deck but a hand or two<lb/>  
keeping the anchor-watch. With this arrangement, <lb/>therefore, Jack Tier was obliged to be content.</p>
            <p>Some fifteen or twenty minutes more passed; during<lb/>  
which the Mexican again alluded to his country, and his<lb/>  
regrets at her deplorable situation. The battles of the 8th<lb/>  
and 9th of May; two combats that ought to, and which will<lb/>  
reflect high honour on the little army that won them, as<lb/>  
well as on that hardly worked, and in some respects hardly<lb/>  
used, service to which they belong, had been just fought.<lb/>  
Don Juan mentioned these events without reserve; and <lb/>frankly admitted that success had fallen to the portion of much the<lb/>  
weaker party. He ascribed the victory to the great <lb/>superiority of the American officers of inferior rank; it being<lb/>  
well known that in the service of the “Republic of the<lb/>  
North,” as he termed America, men who had been <lb/>regularly educated at the military academy, and who had <lb/>reached the period of middle life, were serving in the stations<lb/>  
of captains, and sometimes in that of lieutenants; men who,<lb/>  
in many cases, were fitted to command regiments and <lb/>brigades, having been kept in these lower stations by the <lb/>
               <pb n="106"/>tardiness with which promotion comes in an army like that<lb/>  
of this country.</p>
            <p>Don Juan Montefalderon was not sufficiently conversant<lb/>  
with the subject, perhaps, else he might have added, that<lb/>  
when occasions <hi rend="italics">do</hi> offer to bestow on these gentlemen the<lb/>  
preferment they have so hardly and patiently earned, they<lb/>  
are too often neglected, in order to extend the circle of<lb/>  
vulgar political patronage. He did not know that when a<lb/>  
new regiment of dragoons was raised, one permanent in<lb/>  
its character, and intended to be identified with the army<lb/>  
in all future time, that, instead of giving its commissions<lb/>  
to those who had fairly earned them by long privations and<lb/>  
faithful service, they were given, with one or two <lb/>exceptions, to strangers.</p>
            <p>No government trifles more with its army and navy than<lb/>  
our own. So niggardly are the master-spirits at <lb/>Washington of the honours justly earned by military men, that we<lb/>  
have fleets still commanded by captains, and armies by <lb/>officers whose regular duty it would be to command brigades.<lb/>  
The world is edified with the sight of forces sufficient, in<lb/>  
numbers, and every other military requisite, to make one<lb/>  
of Napoleon's <hi rend="italics">corps de armée,</hi> led by one whose commission<lb/>  
would place him properly at the head of a brigade, and<lb/>  
nobly led, too. Here, when so favourable an occasion <lb/>offers to add a regiment or two to the old permanent line of<lb/>  
the army, and thus infuse new life into its hope deferred,<lb/>  
the opportunity is overlooked, and the rank and file are to<lb/>  
be obtained by cramming, instead of by a generous regard<lb/>  
to the interests of the gallant gentlemen who have done so<lb/>  
much for the honour of the American name, and, <lb/>unhappily, so little for themselves. The extra-patriots of the<lb/>  
nation, and they form a legion large enough to trample the<lb/>  
“Halls of the Montezumas” under their feet, tell us that<lb/>  
the reward of those other patriots beneath the shadows of<lb/>  
the Sierra Madre, is to be in the love and approbation of<lb/>  
their fellow citizens, at the very moment when they are<lb/>  
giving the palpable proof of the value of this esteem, and<lb/>  
of the inconstancy of popular applause, by pointing their<lb/>  
fingers, on account of an inadvertent expression in a letter,<lb/>  
at the gallant soldier who taught, in our own times, the<lb/>  
troops of this country to stand up to the best appointed <lb/>
               <pb n="107"/>regiments of England, and to carry off victory from the pride<lb/>  
of Europe, in fair field-fights. Alas! alas! it is true of<lb/>  
nations as well as of men, in their simplest and earliest<lb/>  
forms of association, that there are “secrets in all families;”<lb/>  
and it will no more do to dwell on our own, than it would<lb/>  
edify us to expose those of poor Mexico.</p>
            <p>The discourse between the Señor Montefalderon and<lb/>  
Mulford was interesting, as it ever has been when the <lb/>former spoke of his unfortunate country. On the subject of<lb/>  
the battles of May he was candid, and admitted his deep<lb/>  
mortification and regrets. He had expected more from the<lb/>  
force collected on the Rio Grande, though, understanding<lb/>  
the northern character better than most of his countrymen,<lb/>  
he had not been as much taken by surprise as the great<lb/>  
bulk of his own nation.</p>
            <p>“Nevertheless, Don Henrique,” he concluded, for the<lb/>  
voice of Spike was just then heard as he was descending<lb/>  
the stairs of the light-house, “nevertheless, Don Henrique,<lb/>  
there is one thing that your people, brave, energetic, and<lb/>  
powerful as I acknowledge them to be, would do well to<lb/>  
remember, and it is this—no nation of the numbers of ours<lb/>  
can be, or ever was conquered, unless by the force of <lb/>political combinations. In a certain state of society a <lb/>government may be overturned, or a capital taken, and carry a<lb/>  
whole country along with it, but our condition is one not<lb/>  
likely to bring about such a result. We are of a race <lb/>different from the Anglo-Saxon, and it will not be easy either<lb/>  
to assimilate us to your own, or wholly to subdue us. In<lb/>  
those parts of the country, where the population is small,<lb/>  
in time, no doubt, the Spanish race might be absorbed,<lb/>  
and your sway established; but ages of war would be <lb/>necessary entirely to obliterate our usages, our language, and<lb/>  
our religion from the peopled portions of Mexico.”</p>
            <p>It might be well for some among us to reflect on these<lb/>  
matters. The opinions of Don Juan, in our judgment,<lb/>  
being entitled to the consideration of all prudent and <lb/>considerate men.</p>
            <p>As Spike descended to the door of the light-house, <lb/>Harry, Rose, and Jack Tier retired within that of the dwelling.<lb/>  
Presently the voice of the captain was heard hailing the<lb/>  
Mexican, and together they walked to the wharf, the<lb/>
               <pb n="108"/>  
former boasting to the latter of his success in making a<lb/>  
brilliant light. Brilliant it was, indeed; so brilliant as to<lb/>  
give Mulford many misgivings on the subject of the boat.<lb/>  
The light from the lantern fell upon the wharf, and he<lb/>  
could see the boat from the window where he stood, with<lb/>  
Spike standing nearly over it, waiting for the men to get<lb/>  
his own yawl ready. It is true, the captain's back was<lb/>  
toward the dangerous object, and the planks of the bridge<lb/>  
were partly between him and it; but there was a serious<lb/>  
danger that was solely averted by the circumstance that<lb/>  
Spike was so earnestly dilating on some subject to Don<lb/>  
Juan, as to look only at that gentleman's face. A minute<lb/>  
later they were all in the yawl, which pulled rapidly toward<lb/>  
the brig.</p>
            <p>Don Juan Montefalderon was not long absent. Ten<lb/>  
minutes sufficed for the boat to reach the Swash, for him<lb/>  
to obtain his cloak, and to return to the islet alone, no one<lb/>  
in the vessel feeling a desire to interfere with his imaginary<lb/>  
prayers. As for the people, it was not probable that one<lb/>  
in the brig could have been induced to accompany him to<lb/>  
the graves at that hour; though everybody but Josh had<lb/>  
turned-in, as he informed Mulford, to catch short naps <lb/>previously to the hour of getting the brig under way. As for<lb/>  
the steward, he had been placed on the look-out as the<lb/>  
greatest idler on board. All this was exceedingly <lb/>favourable to Jack Tier's project, since Josh was already in the<lb/>  
secret of his absence, and would not be likely to betray his<lb/>  
return. After a brief consultation, it was agreed to wait<lb/>  
half an hour or an hour, in order to let the sleepers lose all<lb/>  
consciousness, when Don Juan proposed returning to the<lb/>  
vessel with his new companion.</p>
            <p>The thirty or forty minutes that succeeded were passed<lb/>  
in general conversation. On this occasion the Señor <lb/>Montefalderon spoke more freely than he had yet done of recent<lb/>  
events. He let it be plainly seen how much he despised<lb/>  
Spike, and how irksome to him was the intercourse he was<lb/>  
obliged to maintain, and to which he only submitted<lb/>  
through a sense of duty. The money known to be in the<lb/>  
schooner, was of a larger amount than had been supposed;<lb/>  
and every dollar was so important to Mexico, at that <lb/>moment, that he did not like to abandon it, else, did he <lb/>
               <pb n="109"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>declare, that he would quit the brig at once, and share in the<lb/>  
fortunes of Harry and Rose. He courteously expressed<lb/>  
his best wishes for the happiness of the young couple, and<lb/>  
delicately intimated that, under the circumstances, he <lb/>supposed that they would be united as soon as they could<lb/>  
reach a place where the marriage rite could be celebrated.<lb/>  
This was said in the most judicious way possible; so <lb/>delicately as not to wound any one's feelings, and in a way to<lb/>  
cause it to resemble the announcement of an expectation,<lb/>  
rather than the piece of paternal advice for which it was<lb/>  
really intended. Harry was delighted with this suggestion<lb/>  
of his Mexican friend—the most loyal American may still<lb/>  
have a sincere friend of Mexican birth and Mexican <lb/>feelings, too—since it favoured not only his secret wishes, but<lb/>  
his secret expectations also.</p>
            <p>At the appointed moment, Don Juan Montefalderon and<lb/>  
Jack Tier took their leave of the two they left behind them.<lb/>  
Rose manifested what to Harry seemed a strange <lb/>reluctance to part with the little steward; but Tier was bent on<lb/>  
profiting by this excellent opportunity to get back to the<lb/>  
brig. They went, accordingly, and the anxious listeners,<lb/>  
who watched the slightest movement of the yawl, from the<lb/>  
shore, had reason to believe that Jack was smuggled in<lb/>  
without detection. They heard the familiar sound of the<lb/>  
oar falling in the boat, and Mulford said that Josh's voice<lb/>  
might be distinguished, answering to a call from Don Juan.<lb/>  
No noise or clamour was heard, such as Spike would <lb/>certainly have made, had he detected the deception that had<lb/>  
been practised on himself.</p>
            <p>Harry and Rose were now alone. The former <lb/>suggested that the latter should take possession of one of the little<lb/>  
bed-rooms that are usually to be found in American <lb/>dwellings of the dimensions and humble character of the <lb/>lighthouse abode, while he kept watch until the brig should sail.<lb/>  
Until Spike was fairly off, he would not trust himself to<lb/>  
sleep; but there was no sufficient reason why Rose should<lb/>  
not endeavour to repair the evil of a broken night's rest,<lb/>  
like that which had been passed in the boat. With this<lb/>  
understanding, then, our heroine took possession of her<lb/>  
little apartment, where she threw herself on the bed in her<lb/>
               <pb n="110"/>  
clothes, while Mulford walked out into the air, as the most<lb/>  
effective means of helping to keep his eyes open.</p>
            <p>It was now some time past ten, and before eleven the<lb/>  
moon would rise. The mate consequently knew that his<lb/>  
watch could not be long before Spike would quit the <lb/>neighbourhood—a circumstance pregnant with immense relief<lb/>  
to him, at least. So long as that unscrupulous, and now<lb/>  
nearly desperate, man remained anywhere near Rose, he<lb/>  
felt that she could not be safe; and as he paced the sands,<lb/>  
on the off, or outer side of the islet, in order to be beyond<lb/>  
the influence of the light in the lantern, his eye was <lb/>scarcely a moment taken away from the Swash, so impatiently<lb/>  
and anxiously did he wait for the signs of some movement<lb/>  
on board her.</p>
            <p>The moon rose, and Mulford heard the well-known raps<lb/>  
on the booby-hatch, which precedes the call of “all hands,”<lb/>  
on board a merchant-man. “All hands up anchor, ahoy!”<lb/>  
succeeded, and in less than five minutes the bustle on<lb/>  
board the brig announced the fact, that her people were<lb/>  
“getting the anchor.” By this time it had got to be so<lb/>  
light that the mate deemed it prudent to return to the<lb/>  
house, in order that he might conceal his person within its<lb/>  
shadows. Awake Rose he would not, though he knew she<lb/>  
would witness the departure of the Swash with a <lb/>satisfaction little short of his own. He thought he would wait,<lb/>  
that when he did speak to her at all, it might be to <lb/>announce their entire safety. As regarded the aunt, Rose<lb/>  
was much relieved on her account, by the knowledge that<lb/>  
Jack Tier would not fail to let Mrs. Budd know everything<lb/>  
connected with her own situation and prospects. The <lb/>desertion of Jack, after coming so far with her, had pained<lb/>  
our heroine in a way we cannot at present explain; but go<lb/>  
he would, probably feeling assured there was no longer any<lb/>  
necessity for his continuance with the lovers, in order to<lb/>  
prevail on Rose to escape from Spike.</p>
            <p>The Swash was not long in getting her ground-tackle,<lb/>  
and the brig was soon seen with her topsail aback, waiting<lb/>  
to cat the anchor. This done, the yards swung round, and<lb/>  
the topsail filled. It was blowing just a good breeze for<lb/>  
such a craft to carry whole sail on a bow-line with, and<lb/>  
away the light and active craft started, like the racer that<lb/>
               <pb n="111"/>  
is galloping for daily exercise. Of course there were <lb/>several passages by which a vessel might quit the group of <lb/>islets, some being larger, and some smaller, but all having<lb/>  
sufficient water for a brigantine of the Molly's draught.<lb/>  
Determined not to lose an inch of distance unnecessarily,<lb/>  
Spike luffed close up to the wind, making an effort to pass<lb/>  
out to windward of the light. In order to do this, <lb/>however, it became necessary for him to make two short tacks<lb/>  
within the haven, which brought him far enough to the<lb/>  
southward and eastward to effect his purpose. While this<lb/>  
was doing, the mate, who perfectly understood the object<lb/>  
of the manoeuvres, passed to the side of the light-house that<lb/>  
was opposite to that on which the dwelling was placed,<lb/>  
with a view to get a better sight of the vessel as she stood<lb/>  
out to sea. In order to do this, however, it was necessary<lb/>  
for the young man to pass through a broad bit of moonlight<lb/>  
but he trusted for his not being seen, to the active manner<lb/>  
in which all hands were employed on board the vessel. It<lb/>  
would seem that, in this respect, Mulford trusted without<lb/>  
his host, for as the vessel drew near, he perceived that six<lb/>  
or eight figures were on the guns of the Swash, or in her<lb/>  
rigging, gesticulating eagerly, and seemingly pointing to<lb/>  
the very spot where he stood. When the brig got fairly<lb/>  
abeam of the light, she would not be a hundred yards <lb/>distant from it, and fearful to complete the exposure of his<lb/>  
person, which he had so inadvertently and unexpectedly<lb/>  
commenced, our mate drew up close to the wall of the<lb/>  
light-house, against which he sustained himself in a <lb/>position as immovable as possible. This movement had been<lb/>  
seen by a single seaman on board the Swash, and the man<lb/>  
happened to be one of those who had landed with Spike<lb/>  
only two hours before. His name was Barlow.</p>
            <p>“Captain Spike, sir,” called out Barlow, who was <lb/>coiling up rigging on the forecastle, and was consequently<lb/>  
obliged to call out so loud as to be heard by all on board,<lb/>  
“yonder is a man at the foot of the light-house.”</p>
            <p>By this time, the moon coming out bright through an<lb/>  
opening in the clouds, Mulford had become conscious of<lb/>  
the risk he ran, and was drawn up, as immovable as the<lb/>  
pile itself, against the stones of the light-house. Such an<lb/>  
announcement brought everybody to leeward, and every<lb/>
               <pb n="112"/>  
head over the bulwarks. Spike himself sprang into the lee<lb/>  
main-chains, where his view was unobstructed, and where<lb/>  
Mulford saw and recognised him, even better than he was<lb/>  
seen and recognised in his own person. All this time the<lb/>  
brig was moving ahead.</p>
            <p>“A man, Barlow!” exclaimed Spike, in the way one a<lb/>  
little bewildered by an announcement expresses his <lb/>surprise. “A man! that can never be. There is no one at<lb/>  
the light-house, you know.”</p>
            <p>“There he stands, sir, with his back to the tower, and<lb/>  
his face this way. His dark figure against the <lb/>whitewashed stones is plain enough to be seen. Living, or dead,<lb/>  
sir, that is the mate!”</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="italics">Living</hi> it cannot be,” answered Spike, though he<lb/>  
gulped at the words the next moment.</p>
            <p>A general exclamation now showed that everybody <lb/>recognised the mate, whose figure, stature, dress, and even<lb/>  
features, were by this time all tolerably distinct. The<lb/>  
fixed attitude, however, the immovable statue-like rigidity<lb/>  
of the form, and all the other known circumstances of<lb/>  
Harry's case, united to produce a common and <lb/>simultaneous impression among the superstitious mariners, that<lb/>  
what they saw was but the ghostly shadow of one lately <lb/>departed to the world of spirits. Even Spike was not free<lb/>  
from this illusion, and his knees shook beneath him, there<lb/>  
where he stood, in the channels of a vessel that he had<lb/>  
handled like a top in so many gales and tempests. With<lb/>  
him, however, the illusion was neither absolute nor lasting.<lb/>  
A second thought told him it could scarcely be so, and<lb/>  
then he found his voice. By this time the brig was nearly<lb/>  
abreast of where Harry stood.</p>
            <p>“You Josh!” called out Spike, in a voice of thunder,<lb/>  
loud enough to startle even Mrs. Budd and Biddy in their<lb/>  
berths.</p>
            <p>“Lor' help us all!” answered the negro, “what <hi rend="italics">will  
 </hi>
               <lb/> come next t'ing aboard dis wessel! Here I be, sir.”</p>
            <p>“Pass the fowling-piece out of my state-room. Both<lb/>  
barrels are loaded with ball; I'll try him, though the <lb/>bullets<hi rend="italics">are</hi> only lead.”</p>
            <p>A common exclamation of dissatisfaction escaped the<lb/>  
men, while Josh was obeying the order. “It's no use.”<lb/>
               <pb n="113"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
“You never can hurt one of them things,” “Something will<lb/>  
befall the brig on account of this,” and “It's the mate's<lb/>  
sperit, and sperits can't be harmed by lead or iron,” were<lb/>  
the sort of remarks made by the seamen, during the short<lb/>  
interval between the issuing the order for the fowling-piece<lb/>  
and its execution.</p>
            <p>“There 't is, Cap'in Spike,” said Josh, passing the piece<lb/>  
up through the rigging, “but 't will no more shoot <hi rend="italics">that  
 </hi>
               <lb/> thing, than one of our carronades would blow up Gibraltar.”</p>
            <p>By this time Spike was very determined, his lips being<lb/>  
compressed and his teeth set, as he took the gun and<lb/>  
cocked it. Then he hailed. As all that passed occurred,<lb/>  
as it might be, at once, the brig even at that moment was<lb/>  
little more than abreast of the immovable mate, and about<lb/>  
eighty yards from him.</p>
            <p>“Light-house, there!” cried Spike—“Living or dead,<lb/>  
answer or I fire.”</p>
            <p>No answer came, and no motion appeared in the dark<lb/>  
figure that was now very plainly visible, under a bright<lb/>  
moon, drawn in high relief against the glittering white of<lb/>  
the tower. Spike dropped the muzzle to its aim, and fired.</p>
            <p>So intense was the attention of all in the Swash, that a<lb/>  
wink of Harry's could almost have been seen, had he <lb/>betrayed even that slight sign of human infirmity at the flash<lb/>  
and the report. The ball was flattened against a stone of<lb/>  
the building, within a foot of the mate's body; but he did<lb/>  
not stir. All depended now on his perfect immovability,<lb/>  
as he well knew; and he so far commanded himself, as to<lb/>  
remain rigid as if of stone himself.</p>
            <p>“There! one can see how it is—no life in that being,”<lb/>  
said one. “I know'd how it would end,” added another.<lb/>  
“Nothing but silver, and that cast on purpose, will ever<lb/>  
lay it,” continued a third. But Spike disregarded all.<lb/>  
This time he was resolved that his aim should be better,<lb/>  
and he was inveterately deliberate in getting it. Just as he<lb/>  
pulled the trigger, however, Don Juan Montefalderon<lb/>  
touched his elbow, the piece was fired, and there stood the<lb/>  
immovable figure as before, fixed against the tower. Spike<lb/>  
was turning angrily to chide his Mexican friend for <lb/>deranging his aim, when the report of an answering musket came<lb/>  
back like an echo. Every eye was turned toward the<lb/>
               <pb n="114"/>  
figure, but it moved not. Then the humming sound of an<lb/>  
advancing ball was heard, and a bullet passed, whistling<lb/>  
hoarsely, through the rigging, and fell some distance to<lb/>  
windward. Every head disappeared below the bulwarks.<lb/>  
Even Spike was so far astonished as to spring in upon deck,<lb/>  
and, for a single instant, not a man was to be seen above<lb/>  
the monkey-rail of the brig. Then Spike recovered <lb/>himself and jumped upon a gun. His first look was toward<lb/>  
the light-house, now on the vessel's lee-quarter; but the<lb/>  
spot where had so lately been seen the form of Mulford,<lb/>  
showed nothing but the glittering brightness of the <lb/>whitewashed stones!</p>
            <p>The reader will not be surprised to learn that all these<lb/>  
events produced a strange and deep impression on board<lb/>  
the Molly Swash. The few who might have thrown a little<lb/>  
light on the matter were discreetly silent, while all that<lb/>  
portion of the crew which was in the dark, firmly believed<lb/>  
that the spirit of the murdered mate was visiting them, in<lb/>  
order to avenge the wrongs inflicted on it in the flesh.<lb/>  
The superstition of sailors is as deep as it is general. All<lb/>  
those of the Molly, too, were salts of the old school, <lb/>seadogs of a past generation, properly speaking, and mariners<lb/>  
who had got their notions in the early part of the century,<lb/>  
when the spirit of progress was less active than it is at<lb/>  
present.</p>
            <p>Spike himself might have had other misgivings, and <lb/>believed that he had seen the living form of his intended <lb/>victim, but for the extraordinary and ghost-like echo of his<lb/>  
last discharge. There was nothing visible, or intelligible,<lb/>  
from which that fire could have come, and he was perfectly<lb/>  
bewildered by the whole occurrence. An intention to<lb/>  
round-to, as soon as through the passage, down boat and<lb/>  
land, which had been promptly conceived when he found<lb/>  
that his first aim had failed, was as suddenly abandoned,<lb/>  
and he gave the command to board fore-tack;” <lb/>immediately after, his call was to “pack on the brig,” and not <lb/>without a little tremour in his voice, as soon as he perceived<lb/>  
that the figure had vanished. The crew was not slow to<lb/>  
obey these orders, and in ten minutes, the Swash was a<lb/>  
mile from the light, standing to the northward and eastward,<lb/>  
under a press of canvas, and with a freshening breeze.</p>
            <pb n="115"/>
            <p/>
            <p>To return to the islets. Harry, from the first, had seen<lb/>  
that everything depended on his remaining motionless. As<lb/>  
the people of the brig were partly in shadow, he could not,<lb/>  
and did not, fully understand how completely he was <lb/>himself exposed, in consequence of the brightness of all around<lb/>  
him, and he had at first hoped to be mistaken for some <lb/>accidental resemblance to a man. His nerves were well<lb/>  
tried by the use of the fowling-piece, but they proved equal<lb/>  
to the necessities of the occasion. But, when an <lb/>answering report came from the rear, or from the opposite side of<lb/>  
the islet, he darted round the tower, as much taken by <lb/>surprise, and overcome by wonder, as any one else who heard<lb/>  
it. It was this rapid movement which caused his flight to<lb/>  
be unnoticed, all the men of the brig dodging below their<lb/>  
own bulwarks at that precise instant.</p>
            <p>As the light-house was now between the mate and the<lb/>  
brig, he had no longer any motive for trying to conceal<lb/>  
himself. His first thought was of Rose, and, strange as it<lb/>  
may seem, for some little time he fancied that she had<lb/>  
found a musket in the dwelling, and discharged it, in order<lb/>  
to aid his escape. The events had passed so swiftly, that<lb/>  
there was no time for the cool consideration of anything,<lb/>  
and it is not surprising that some extravagances mingled<lb/>  
with the first surmises of all these.</p>
            <p>On reaching the door of the house, therefore, Harry was<lb/>  
by no means surprised at seeing Rose standing in it, gazing<lb/>  
at the swiftly receding brigantine. He even looked for the<lb/>  
musket, expecting to see it lying at her feet, or leaning<lb/>  
against the wall of the building. Rose, however, was <lb/>entirely unarmed, and as dependent on him for support, as<lb/>  
when he had parted from her, an hour or two before.</p>
            <p>“Where did you find that musket, Rose, and what have<lb/>  
you done with it?” inquired Harry, as soon as he had<lb/>  
looked in every place he thought likely to hold such an<lb/>  
implement.</p>
            <p>“Musket, Harry! I have had no musket, though the<lb/>  
report of fire-arms, near by, awoke me from a sweet sleep.”</p>
            <p>“Is this possible! I had imprudently trusted myself on<lb/>  
the other side of the light-house, while the moon was <lb/>behind clouds, and when they broke suddenly away, its light<lb/>  
betrayed me to those on board the brig. Spike fired at me<lb/>
               <pb n="116"/>  
twice, without injuring me; when, to my astonishment, an<lb/>  
answering report was heard from the islet. What is more,<lb/>  
the piece was charged with a ball-cartridge, for I heard the<lb/>  
whistling of the bullet as it passed on its way to the brig.”</p>
            <p>“And you supposed I had fired that musket?”</p>
            <p>“Whom else could I suppose had done it? You are<lb/>  
not a very likely person to do such a thing, I will own, my<lb/>  
love; but there are none but us two here.”</p>
            <p>“It must be Jack Tier,” exclaimed Rose suddenly.</p>
            <p>“That is impossible, since he has left us.”</p>
            <p>“One never knows. Jack understood how anxious I<lb/>  
was to retain him with us, and he is so capricious and full<lb/>  
of schemes, that he may have contrived to get out of the<lb/>  
brig, as artfully as he got on board her.”</p>
            <p>“If Jack Tier be actually on this islet, I shall set him<lb/>  
down as little else than a conjuror.”</p>
            <p>“Hist!” interrupted Rose, “what noise is that in the<lb/>  
direction of the wharf? It sounds like an oar falling in a<lb/>  
boat.”</p>
            <p>Mulford heard that well-known sound, as well as his<lb/>  
companion, and, followed by Rose, he passed swiftly<lb/>  
through the house, coming out at the front, next the wharf.<lb/>  
The moon was still shining bright, and the mystery of the<lb/>  
echoing report, and answering shot, was immediately <lb/>explained. A large boat, one that pulled ten oars, at least,<lb/>  
was just coming up to the end of the wharf, and the <lb/>manner in which its oars were unshipped and tossed, announced<lb/>  
to the mate that the crew were man-of-war's men. He<lb/>  
walked hastily forward to meet them.</p>
            <p>Three officers first left the boat together. The gold<lb/>  
bands of their caps showed that they belonged to the <lb/>quarter-deck, a fact that the light of the moon made apparent<lb/>  
at once, though it was not strong enough to render features<lb/>  
distinct. As Mulford continued to advance, however, the<lb/>  
three officers saluted him.</p>
            <p>“I see you have got the light under way once more,”<lb/>  
observed the leader of the party. “Last night it was as<lb/>  
dark as Erebus in your lantern.”</p>
            <p>“The light-house keeper and his assistant have both<lb/>  
been drowned,” answered Mulford. “The lamps have<lb/>
               <pb n="117"/>  
been lit to-night by the people of the brig which has just<lb/>  
gone out.”</p>
            <p>“Pray, sir, what brig may that be?”</p>
            <p>“The Molly Swash, of New York; a craft that I lately<lb/>  
belonged to myself, but which I have left on account of her<lb/>  
evil doings.”</p>
            <p>“The Molly Swash, Stephen Spike master and owner,<lb/>  
bound to Key West and a market, with a cargo of eight<lb/>  
hundred barrels of flour, and that of a quality so lively and<lb/>  
pungent that it explodes like gunpowder! I beg your <lb/>pardon, Mr. Mate, for not recognising you sooner. Have you<lb/>  
forgotten the Poughkeepsie, Captain Mull, and her <lb/>farreaching Paixhans?”</p>
            <p>“I ought to ask your pardon, Mr. Wallace, for not <lb/>recognising<hi rend="italics">you</hi> sooner, too. But one does not distinguish<lb/>  
well by moonlight. I am delighted to see you, sir, and<lb/>  
now hope that, with my assistance, a stop can be put to<lb/>  
the career of the brig.”</p>
            <p>“What, Mr. Mate, do <hi rend="italics">you</hi> turn against your craft?”<lb/>  
said Wallace, under the impulsive feeling which induces<lb/>  
all loyal men to have a distaste for treachery of every sort,<lb/>  
“the seaman should love the very planks of his vessel.”</p>
            <p>“I fully understand you, Mr. Wallace, and will own<lb/>  
that, for a long time, I was tied to rascality by the opinions<lb/>  
to which you allude. But, when you come to hear my <lb/>explanation, I do not fear your judgment in the least.”</p>
            <p>Mulford now led the way into the house, whither Rose<lb/>  
had already retreated, and where she had lighted candles,<lb/>  
and made other womanly arrangements for receiving her<lb/>  
guests. At Harry's suggestion, some of the soup was<lb/>  
placed over coals, to warm up for the party, and our <lb/>heroine made her preparations to comfort them also with a cup<lb/>  
of tea. While she was thus employed, Mulford gave the<lb/>  
whole history of his connection with the brig, his <lb/>indisposition to quit the latter, the full exposure of Spike's treason,<lb/>  
his own desertion, if desertion it could be called, the loss<lb/>  
of the schooner, and his abandonment on the rock, and the<lb/>  
manner in which he had been finally relieved. It was<lb/>  
scarcely possible to relate all these matters, and altogether<lb/>  
avoid allusions to the schemes of Spike in connection with<lb/>  
Rose, and the relation in which our young man himself<lb/>
               <pb n="118"/>  
stood toward her. Although Mulford touched on these<lb/>  
points with great delicacy, it was as a seaman talking to<lb/>  
seamen, and he could not entirely throw aside the <lb/>frankness of the profession. Ashore, men live in the privacy of<lb/>  
their own domestic circles, and their secrets, and secret<lb/>  
thoughts, are “family secrets,” of which it has passed into<lb/>  
a proverb to say, that there are always some, even in the<lb/>  
best of these communities. On shipboard, or in the camp,<lb/>  
it is very different. The close contact in which men are<lb/>  
brought with each other, the necessity that exists for <lb/>opening the heart and expanding the charities, gets in time to<lb/>  
influence the whole character, and a certain degree of<lb/>  
frankness and simplicity, takes the place of the reserve and<lb/>  
acting that might have been quickened in the same <lb/>individual, under a different system of schooling. But Mulford<lb/>  
was frank by nature, as well as by his sea-education, and<lb/>  
his companions on this occasion were pretty well possessed<lb/>  
of all his wishes and plans, in reference to Rose, even to<lb/>  
his hope of falling in with the chaplain of the <lb/>Poughkeepsie, by the time his story was all told. The fact that Rose<lb/>  
was occupied in another room, most of the time, had made<lb/>  
these explanations all the easier, and spared her many a<lb/>  
blush. As for the man-of-war's men, they listened to the<lb/>  
tale, with manly interest and a generous sympathy.</p>
            <p>“I am glad to hear your explanation, Mr. Mate,” said<lb/>  
Wallace, cordially, as soon as Harry had done, “and<lb/>  
there's my hand, in proof that I approve of your course. I<lb/>  
own to a radical dislike of a turncoat, or a traitor to his<lb/>  
craft, Brother Hollins”—looking at the elder of his two<lb/>  
companions, one of whom was the midshipman who had<lb/>  
originally accompanied him on board the Swash—“and am<lb/>  
glad to find that our friend Mulford here is neither. A<lb/>  
true-hearted sailor can be excused for deserting even his<lb/>  
own ship, under such circumstances.”</p>
            <p>“I am glad to hear even this little concession from you,<lb/>  
Wallace,” answered Hollins, good-naturedly, and speaking<lb/>  
with a mild expression of benevolence, on a very calm and<lb/>  
thoughtful countenance. “Your mess is as heteredox as<lb/>  
any I ever sailed with, on the subject of our duties, in this<lb/>  
respect.”</p>
            <pb n="119"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“I hold it to be a sailor's duty to stick by his ship, <hi rend="italics">
                  <lb/>reverend</hi> and dear sir.”</p>
            <p>This mode of address, which was used by the “ship's<lb/>  
gentleman” in the cant of the ward-room, as a pleasantry of<lb/>  
an old shipmate, for the two had long sailed together in<lb/>  
other vessels, at once announced to Harry that he saw the<lb/>  
very chaplain for whose presence he had been so anxiously<lb/>  
wishing. The “reverend and dear sir” smiled at the sally<lb/>  
of his friend, a sort of thing to which he was very well <lb/>accustomed, but he answered with a gravity and point that,<lb/>  
it is to be presumed, he thought befitting his holy office.</p>
            <p>It may be well to remark here, that the Rev. Mr. Hollins<lb/>  
was not one of the “lunch'd chaplains,” that used to do<lb/>  
discredit to the navy of this country, or a layman dubbed<lb/>  
with such a title, and rated that he might get the pay and<lb/>  
become a boon companion of the captain, at the table and<lb/>  
in his frolics ashore. Those days are gone by, and <lb/>ministers of the gospel are now really employed to care for the<lb/>  
souls of the poor sailors, who so long have been treated by<lb/>  
others, and have treated themselves, indeed, as if they were<lb/>  
beings without souls, altogether. In these particulars, the<lb/>  
world has certainly advanced, though the wise and the<lb/>  
good, in looking around them, may feel more cause for <lb/>astonishment in contemplating what it once was, than to <lb/>rejoice in what it actually is. But intellect has certainly<lb/>  
improved in the aggregate, if not in its especial <lb/>dispensations, and men will not now submit to abuses that, within<lb/>  
the recollections of a generation, they even cherished. In<lb/>  
reference to the more intellectual appointments of a ship<lb/>  
of war, the commander excepted, for we contend he who<lb/>  
directs all, ought to possess the most capacity, but, in <lb/>reference to what are ordinarily believed to be the more <lb/>intellectual appointments of a vessel of war, the surgeon and<lb/>  
the chaplain, we well recollect opinions that were expressed<lb/>  
to us, many years since, by two officers of the highest rank<lb/>  
known to the service. “When I first entered the navy,”<lb/>  
said one of these old Benbows, “if I had occasion for the<lb/>  
amputation of a leg, and the question lay between the <lb/>carpenter and the doctor, d—e, but I would have tried the<lb/>  
carpenter first, for I felt pretty certain he would have been<lb/>  
the most likely to get through with the job.” “In old<lb/>
               <pb n="120"/>  
times,” said the other, “when a chaplain joined a ship, the<lb/>  
question immediately arose, whether the mess were to <lb/>convert the chaplain, or the chaplain, the mess; and the mess<lb/>  
generally got the best of it.” There was very little <lb/>exaggeration in either of these opinions. But, happily, all this<lb/>  
is changed vastly for the better, and a navy-surgeon is <lb/>necessarily a man of education and experience; in very many<lb/>  
instances, men of high talents are to be found among them;<lb/>  
while chaplains can do something better than play at <lb/>backgammon, eat terrapins, when in what may be called <lb/>terrapin-ports, and drink brandy and water, or pure Bob Smith.<note target="eaf079v2.1" place="unspecified" anchored="true">1</note>
            </p>
            <p>“It is a great mistake, Wallace, to fancy that the <lb/>highest duty a man owes, is either to his ship or to his  
<lb/>country,” observed the Rey. Mr. Hollins, quietly. “The highest<lb/>  
duty of each and all of us, is to God; and whatever <lb/>conflicts with that duty, must be avoided as a transgression of<lb/>  
his laws, and consequently as sin.”</p>
            <p>“You surprise me, reverend and dear sir! I do not <lb/>remember ever to have heard you broach such opinions <lb/>before, which might be interpreted to mean that a fellow<lb/>  
might be disloyal to his flag.”</p>
            <p>“Because the opinion might be liable to <lb/>misinterpretation. Still, I do not go as far as many of my friends on<lb/>  
this subject. If Decatur ever really said, ‘Our country,<lb/>  
right or wrong,’ he said what might be just enough, and<lb/>  
creditable enough, in certain cases, and taken with the fair<lb/>  
limitations that he probably intended should accompany<lb/>  
the sentiment; but, if he meant it as an absolute and <lb/>controlling principle, it was not possible to be more in error.<lb/>  
In this last sense, such a rule of conduct might, and in old<lb/>  
times often would, have justified idolatry; nay, it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a <lb/>species of idolatry in itself, since it is putting country before<lb/>  
God. Sailors may not always be able to make the just <lb/>distinctions in these cases, but the quarter-deck should be so,<lb/>  
irreverend and dear sir.”</p>
            <p>Wallace laughed, and then he turned the discourse to<lb/>  
the subject more properly before them.</p>
            <p>“I understand you to say, Mr. Mulford,” he remarked,<lb/>
               <pb n="121"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
“that, in your opinion, the Swash has gone to try to raise<lb/>  
the unfortunate Mexican schooner, a second time, from the<lb/>  
depths of the ocean?”</p>
            <p>“From the rock on which she lies. Under the <lb/>circumstances, I hardly think he would have come hither for the<lb/>  
chain and cable, unless with some such object. We know,<lb/>  
moreover, thut such <hi rend="italics">was</hi> his intention when we left the<lb/>  
brig.”</p>
            <p>“And you can take us to the very spot where that wreck<lb/>  
lies?”</p>
            <p>“Without any difficulty. Her masts are partly out of<lb/>  
water, and we hung on to them, in our boat, no later than<lb/>  
last night, or this morning rather.”</p>
            <p>“So far, well. Your conduct in all this affair will be<lb/>  
duly appreciated, and Captain Mull will not fail to <lb/>represent it in a right point of view to the government.”</p>
            <p>“Where is the ship, sir? I looked for her most <lb/>anxiously, without success, last evening; nor had Jack Tier, the<lb/>  
little fellow I have named to you, any better luck; though<lb/>  
I sent him aloft, as high as the lantern in the light-house,<lb/>  
for that purpose.”</p>
            <p>“The ship is off here to the northward and westward,<lb/>  
some six leagues or so. At sunset she may have been a<lb/>  
little further. We have supposed that the Swash would be<lb/>  
coming back hither, and had laid a trap for her, which<lb/>  
came very near taking her alive.”</p>
            <p>“What is the trap you mean, sir—though taking <lb/>Stephen Spike alive, is sooner said than done.”</p>
            <p>“Our plan has been to catch him with our boats. With<lb/>  
the greater draft of water of the Poughkeepsie, and the<lb/>  
heels of your brig, sir, a regular chase about these reefs, as<lb/>  
we knew from experience, would be almost hopeless. It<lb/>  
was, therefore, necessary to use head-work, and some <lb/>man-of-war traverses, in order to lay hold of him. Yesterday<lb/>  
afternoon we hoisted out three cutters, manned them, and<lb/>  
made sail in them all, under our luggs, working up against<lb/>  
the trades. Each boat took its own course, one going off,<lb/>  
the west end of the reef, one going more to the eastward,<lb/>  
while I came this way, to look in at the Dry Tortugas.<lb/>  
Spike will be lucky if he do not fall in with our third <lb/>cutter, which is under the fourth lieutenant, should he stand<lb/>
               <pb n="122"/>  
on far on the same tack as that on which he left this place.<lb/>  
Let him try his fortune, however. As for our boat, as soon<lb/>  
as I saw the lamps burning in the lantern, I made the best<lb/>  
of my way hither, and got sight of the brig, just as she<lb/>  
loosened her sails. Then I took in my own luggs, and<lb/>  
came on with the oars. Had we continued under our <lb/>canvas, with this breeze, I almost think we might have <lb/>overhauled the rascal.”</p>
            <p>“It would have been impossible, sir. The moment he<lb/>  
got a sight of your sails, he would have been off in a <lb/>contrary direction, and that brig really seems to fly, whenever<lb/>  
there is a pressing occasion for her to move. You did the<lb/>  
wisest thing you could have done, and barely missed him,<lb/>  
as it was. He has not seen you at all, as it is, and will be<lb/>  
all the less on his guard, against the next visit from the<lb/>  
ship.”</p>
            <p>“Not seen me! Why, sir, the fellow fired at us <hi rend="italics">t</hi>wice<lb/>  
with a musket; why he did not use a carronade, is more<lb/>  
than I can tell.”</p>
            <p>“Excuse me, Mr. Wallace; those two shots were <lb/>intended for me, though I now fully comprehend why you<lb/>  
answered them.”</p>
            <p>“Answered them! yes, indeed; who would not answer<lb/>  
such a salute, and gun for gun, if he had a chance. I <lb/>certainly thought he was firing at us, and having a musket<lb/>  
between my legs, I let fly in return, and even the chaplain<lb/>  
here will allow that was returning ‘good for evil.’ But<lb/>  
explain your meaning.”</p>
            <p>Mulford now went into the details of the incidents <lb/>connected with his coming into the moon-light, at the foot of<lb/>  
the light-house. That he was not mistaken as to the party<lb/>  
for whom the shots were intended, was plain enough to him,<lb/>  
from the words that passed aloud among the people of the<lb/>  
Swash, as well as from the circumstance that both balls<lb/>  
struck the stones of the tower quite near him. This <lb/>statement explained everything to Wallace, who now fully <lb/>comprehended the cause and motive of each incident.</p>
            <p>It was now near eleven, and Rose had prepared the table<lb/>  
for supper. The gentlemen of the Poughkeepsie <lb/>manifested great interest in the movements of the Hebe-like little<lb/>  
attendant who was caring for their wants. When the cloth<lb/>
               <pb n="123"/>  
was to be laid, the midshipman offered his assistance, but<lb/>  
his superior directed him to send a hand or two up from<lb/>  
the wharf, where the crew of the cutter were lounging or<lb/>  
sleeping after their cruise. These men had been thought<lb/>  
of, too; and a vessel filled with smoking soup was taken to<lb/>  
them, by one of their own number.</p>
            <p>The supper was as cheerful as it was excellent. The<lb/>  
dry humour of Wallace, the mild intelligence of the <lb/>chaplain, the good sense of Harry, and the spirited information<lb/>  
of Rose, contributed, each in its particular way, to make<lb/>  
the meal memorable in more senses than one. The laugh<lb/>  
came easily at that table, and it was twelve o'clock, before<lb/>  
the party thought of breaking up.</p>
            <p>The dispositions for the night were soon made. Rose<lb/>  
returned to her little room, where she could now sleep in<lb/>  
comfort, and without apprehension. The gentlemen made<lb/>  
the disposition of their persons, that circumstances <lb/>allowed; each finding something on which to repose, that was<lb/>  
preferable to a plank. As for the men, they were <lb/>accustomed to hard fare, and enjoyed their present good-luck, to<lb/>  
the top of their bent. It was quite late, before they had<lb/>  
done “spinning their yarns,” and “cracking their jokes,”<lb/>  
around the pot of turtle-soup, and the can of grog that<lb/>  
succeeded it. By half-past twelve, however, everybody<lb/>  
was asleep.</p>
            <p>Mulford was the first person afoot the following morning.<lb/>  
He left the house just as the sun rose, and perceiving that<lb/>  
the “coast was clear” of sharks, he threw off his light <lb/>attire, and plunged into the sea. Refreshed with this <lb/>indulgence, he was returning toward the building, when he met<lb/>  
the chaplain coming in quest of him. This gentleman, a<lb/>  
man of real piety, and of great discretion, had been <lb/>singularly struck, on the preceding night, with the narrative of<lb/>  
our young mate; and he had not failed to note the <lb/>allusions, slight as they were, and delicately put as they had<lb/>  
been, to himself. He saw, at once, the propriety of <lb/>marrying a couple so situated, and now sought Harry, with a<lb/>  
view to bring about so desirable an event, by intimating his<lb/>  
entire willingness to officiate. It is scarcely necessary to<lb/>  
say that very few words were wanting, to persuade the<lb/>  
young man to fall into his views; and as to Rose, he had<lb/>
               <pb n="124"/>  
handed her a short note on the same subject, which he was<lb/>  
of opinion, would be likely to bring her to the same way<lb/>  
of thinking.</p>
            <p>An hour later, all the officers, Harry and Rose, were <lb/>assembled in what might be termed the light-house parlour.<lb/>  
The Rev. Mr. Hollins had neither band, gown, nor <lb/>surplice; but he had what was far better, feeling and piety.<lb/>  
Without a prayer-book he never moved; and he read the<lb/>  
marriage ceremony with a solemnity that was <lb/>communicated to all present. The ring was that which had been<lb/>  
used at the marriage of Rose's parents, and which she wore<lb/>  
habitually, though not on the left hand. In a word, Harry<lb/>  
and Rose were as firmly and legally united, on that solitary<lb/>  
and almost unknown islet, as could have been the case,<lb/>  
had they stood up before the altar of mother Trinity itself,<lb/>  
with a bishop to officiate, and a legion of attendants. After<lb/>  
the compliments which succeeded the ceremony, the whole<lb/>  
party sat down to breakfast.</p>
            <p>If the supper had been agreeable, the morning meal was<lb/>  
not less so. Rose was timid and blushing, as became a<lb/>  
bride, though she could not but feel how much more <lb/>respectable her position became under the protection of Harry<lb/>  
as his wife, than it had been while she was only his <lb/>betrothed. The most delicate deportment, on the part of her<lb/>  
companions, soon relieved her embarrassment however, and<lb/>  
the breakfast passed off without cause for an unhappy <lb/>moment.</p>
            <p>“The ship's standing in toward the light, sir,” reported<lb/>  
the cockswain of the cutter, as the party was still lingering<lb/>  
around the table, as if unwilling to bring so pleasant a meal<lb/>  
to a close. “Since the mist has broke away, we see her,<lb/>  
sir, even to her ports and dead-eyes.”</p>
            <p>“In that case, Sam, she can't be very far off,” answered<lb/>  
Wallace. “Ay, there goes a gun from her, at this <lb/>moment, as much as to say, ‘what has become of all of my<lb/>  
boats?’ Run down and let off a musket; perhaps she will<lb/>  
make out to hear that, as we must be rather to windward,<lb/>  
if anything.”</p>
            <p>The signal was given and understood. A quarter of an<lb/>  
hour later, the Poughkeepsie began to shorten sail. Then<lb/>  
Wallace stationed himself in the cutter, in the centre of<lb/>
               <pb n="125"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
one of the passages, signalling the ship to come on. Ten<lb/>  
minutes later still, the noble craft came into the haven,<lb/>  
passing the still burning light, with her topsails just lifting,<lb/>  
and making a graceful sweep under very reduced sail, she<lb/>  
came to the wind, very near the spot where the Swash had<lb/>  
lain only ten hours before, and dropped an anchor.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Superstition</hi> would seem to be a consequence of a state<lb/>  
of being, in which so much is shadowed forth, while so <lb/>little is accurately known. Our far-reaching thoughts range<lb/>  
over the vast fields of created things, without penetrating<lb/>  
to the secret cause of the existence of even a blade of grass.<lb/>  
We can analyze all substances that are brought into our<lb/>  
crucibles, tell their combinations and tendencies, give a<lb/>  
scientific history of their formation, so far as it is <lb/>connected with secondary facts, their properties, and their uses;<lb/>  
but in each and all, there is a latent natural cause, that<lb/>  
baffles all our inquiries, and tells us that we are merely<lb/>  
men. This is just as true in morals, as in physics—no<lb/>  
man living being equal to attaining the very faith that is<lb/>  
necessary to his salvation, without the special aid of the<lb/>  
spirit of the godhead; and even with that mighty support,<lb/>  
trusting implicitly for all that is connected with a future<lb/>  
that we are taught to believe is eternal, to “the substance<lb/>  
of things <hi rend="italics">hoped</hi> for, and the evidence of things <hi rend="italics">unseen</hi>.”<lb/>  
In a word, this earthly probation of ours, was intended for<lb/>  
finite beings, in the sense of our present existence, leaving<lb/>  
far more to be conjectured, than is understood.</p>
            <pb n="126"/>
            <p/>
            <p>Ignorance and superstition ever bear a close, and even<lb/>  
a mathematical relation to each other. The degrees of the<lb/>  
one, are regulated by the degrees of the other. He who<lb/>  
knows the least believes the most; while he who has seen<lb/>  
the most, without the intelligence to comprehend that<lb/>  
which he has seen, feels, perhaps, the strongest inclination<lb/>  
to refer those things which to him are mysteries, to the <lb/>supernatural and marvellous. Sailors have been, from time<lb/>  
immemorial, more disposed than men of their class on the<lb/>  
land, to indulge in this weakness, which is probably <lb/>heightened by the circumstance of their living constantly and<lb/>  
vividly in the presence of powers that menace equally their<lb/>  
lives and their means, without being in any manner subject<lb/>  
to their control.</p>
            <p>Spike, for a seaman of his degree of education, was not<lb/>  
particularly addicted to the weakness to which we have<lb/>  
just alluded. Nevertheless, he was not altogether free from<lb/>  
it; and recent circumstances contributed to dispose him so<lb/>  
much the more to admit a feeling which, like sin itself, is<lb/>  
ever the most apt to insinuate itself at moments of <lb/>extraordinary moral imbecility, and through the openings left by<lb/>  
previous transgression. As his brig stood off from the<lb/>  
light, the captain paced the deck, greatly disturbed by what<lb/>  
had just passed, and unable to account for it. The boat<lb/>  
of the Poughkeepsie was entirely concealed by the islet,<lb/>  
and there existing no obvious motive for wishing to return,<lb/>  
in order to come at the truth, not a thought to that effect,<lb/>  
for one moment, crossed the mind of the smuggler. So far<lb/>  
from this, indeed, were his wishes, that the Molly did not<lb/>  
seem to him to go half as fast as usual, in his keen desire<lb/>  
to get further and further from a spot where such strange<lb/>  
incidents had occurred.</p>
            <p>As for the men forward, no argument was wanting to<lb/>  
make <hi rend="italics">them</hi> believe that something supernatural had just<lb/>  
passed before their eyes. It was known to them all, that<lb/>  
Mulford had been left on a naked rock, some thirty miles<lb/>  
from that spot; and it was not easy to understand how he<lb/>  
could now be at the Dry Tortugas, planted, as it might be,<lb/>  
on purpose to show himself to the brig, against the tower,<lb/>  
in the bright moonlight, “like a pictur' hung up for his<lb/>  
old shipmates to look at.”</p>
            <pb n="127"/>
            <p/>
            <p>Sombre were the tales that were related that night<lb/>  
among them, many of which related to the sufferings of<lb/>  
men abandoned on desert islands; and all of which <lb/>bordered, more or less, on the supernatural. The crew <lb/>connected the disappearance of the boat with Mulford's apparition,<lb/>  
though the logical inference would have been, that the<lb/>  
body which required planks to transport it, could scarcely<lb/>  
be classed with anything of the world of spirits. The links<lb/>  
in arguments, however, are seldom respected by the <lb/>illiterate and vulgar, who jump to their conclusions, in cases of<lb/>  
the marvellous, much as politicians find an expression of<lb/>  
the common mind in the prepared opinions of the few who<lb/>  
speak for them, totally disregarding the dissenting silence<lb/>  
of the million. While the men were first comparing their<lb/>  
opinions on that which, to them, seemed to be so <lb/>extraordinary, the Señor Montefalderon joined the captain in his<lb/>  
walk, and dropped into a discourse touching the events<lb/>  
which had attended their departure from the haven of the<lb/>  
Dry Tortugas. In this conversation, Don Juan most <lb/>admirably preserved his countenance, as well as his <lb/>self-command, effectually preventing the suspicion of any <lb/>knowledge on his part, that was not common to them both.</p>
            <p>“You did leave the port with the salutes observed,” the<lb/>  
Mexican commenced, with the slightest accent of a <lb/>foreigner, or just enough to show that he was not speaking in his<lb/>  
mother tongue; “salutes paid and returned.”</p>
            <p>“Do you call that saluting, Don Wan? To me, that<lb/>  
infernal shot sounded more like an echo, than anything<lb/>  
else.”</p>
            <p>“And to what do <hi rend="italics">you</hi> ascribe it, Don Esteban?”</p>
            <p>“I wish I could answer that question. Sometimes I<lb/>  
begin to wish I had not left my mate on that naked rock.”</p>
            <p>“There is still time to repair the last wrong; we shall<lb/>  
go within a few miles of the place where the Señor <lb/>Enrique was left; and I can take the yawl, with two men,<lb/>  
and go in search of him, while you are at work on the<lb/>  
wreck.”</p>
            <p>“Do you believe it possible that he can be still there?”<lb/>  
demanded Spike, looking suddenly and intently at his <lb/>companion, while his mind was strangely agitated between <lb/>
               <pb n="128"/>hatred and dread. “If he is there, who and what was <hi rend="italics">he</hi> that<lb/>  
we all saw so plainly at the foot of the light-house?”</p>
            <p>“How should he have left the rock? He was without<lb/>  
food or water; and no man, in all his vigour, could swim<lb/>  
this distance. I see no means of his getting here.”</p>
            <p>“Unless some wrecker, or turtler, fell in with him, and<lb/>  
took him off. Ay, ay, Don Wan; I left him that much<lb/>  
of a chance, at least. No man can say I <hi rend="italics">murdered</hi> my<lb/>  
mate.”</p>
            <p>“I am not aware, Don Esteban, that any one <hi rend="italics">has</hi> said<lb/>  
so hard a thing of you. Still, we have seen neither <lb/>wrecker nor turtler since we have been here; and that lessens<lb/>  
the excellent chance you left Don Enrique.”</p>
            <p>“There is no occasion, señor, to be so particular,”<lb/>  
growled Spike, a little sullenly, in reply. “The chance,<lb/>  
I say, was a <hi rend="italics">good</hi> one, when you consider how many of<lb/>  
them devils of wreckers hang about these reefs. Let this<lb/>  
brig only get fast on a rock, and they would turn up, like<lb/>  
sharks, all around us, each with his maw open for salvage.<lb/>  
But this is neither here nor there; what puzzles me, was<lb/>  
what we saw at the light, half an hour since, and the <lb/>musket that was fired back at us! I <hi rend="italics">know</hi> that the figure at the<lb/>  
foot of the tower did not fire, for my eye was on him from<lb/>  
first to last; and he had no arms. You were on the island<lb/>  
a good bit, and must have known if the light-house keeper<lb/>  
was there or not, Don Wan?”</p>
            <p>“The light-house keeper <hi rend="italics">was</hi> there, Don Esteban—but<lb/>  
he was in his <hi rend="italics">grave</hi>.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, one, I know, was drowned, and buried with<lb/>  
the rest of them; there might, however, have been more<lb/>  
than one. You saw none of the people that had gone to<lb/>  
Key West, in or about the house, Don Wan?”</p>
            <p>“None. If any persons have left the Tortugas to go to<lb/>  
Key West, within a few days, not one of them has yet <lb/>returned.”</p>
            <p>“So I supposed. No, it can be none of <hi rend="italics">them</hi>. Then I<lb/>  
saw his face as plainly as ever I saw it by moon-light, from<lb/>  
aft, for'ard. What is your opinion about seeing the dead<lb/>  
walk on the 'arth, Don Wan?”</p>
            <p>“That I have never seen any such thing myself, Don<lb/>  
Esteban, and consequently know nothing about it.”</p>
            <pb n="129"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“So I supposed; I find it hard to believe it, I do. It<lb/>  
may be a warning to keep us from-coming any more to the<lb/>  
Dry Tortugas; and I must say I have little heart for <lb/>returning to this place, after all that has fell out here. We<lb/>  
can go to the wreck, fish up the doubloons, and be off for<lb/>  
Yucatan. Once in one of your ports, I make no question<lb/>  
that the merits of the Molly will make themselves <lb/>understood, and that we shall soon agree on a price.”</p>
            <p>“What use could we put the brig to, Don Esteban, if<lb/>  
we had her all ready for sea?”</p>
            <p>“That is a strange question to ask in time of war! Give<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">me</hi> such a craft as the Molly, with sixty or eighty men on<lb/>  
board her, in a war like this, and her 'arnin's should not<lb/>  
fall short of half a million within a twelvemonth.”</p>
            <p>“Could we engage you to take charge of her, Don <lb/>Esteban?”</p>
            <p>“That would be ticklish work, Don Wan. But we can<lb/>  
see. No one knows what he will do until he is tried. In<lb/>  
for a penny, in for a pound. A fellow never knows! Ha!<lb/>  
ha! ha! Don Wan, we live in a strange world—yes, in a<lb/>  
strange world.”</p>
            <p>“We live in strange <hi rend="italics">times,</hi> Don Esteban, as the situation<lb/>  
of my poor country proves. But let us talk this matter<lb/>  
over a little more in confidence.”</p>
            <p>And they did thus discuss the subject. It was a <lb/>singular spectacle to see an honourable man, one full of zeal of<lb/>  
the purest nature in behalf of his own country, sounding a<lb/>  
traitor as to the terms on which he might be induced to do<lb/>  
all the harm he could, to those who claimed his allegiance.<lb/>  
Such sights, however, are often seen; our own especial<lb/>  
objects too frequently blinding us to the obligations that we<lb/>  
owe morality, so far as not to be instrumental in effecting<lb/>  
even what we conceive to be good, by questionable <lb/>agencies. But the Señor Montefalderon kept in view, <lb/>principally, his desire to be useful to Mexico, blended a little too<lb/>  
strongly, perhaps, with the wishes of a man who was born<lb/>  
near the sun, to avenge his wrongs, real or fancied.</p>
            <p>While this dialogue was going on between Spike and<lb/>  
his passenger, as they paced the quarter-deck, one quite as<lb/>  
characteristic occurred in the galley, within twenty feet of<lb/>  
them—Simon, the cook, and Josh, the steward, being the<lb/>
               <pb n="130"/>  
interlocutors. As they talked secrets, they conferred <lb/>together with closed doors, though few were ever disposed<lb/>  
to encounter the smoke, grease, and fumes of their narrow<lb/>  
domains, unless called thither by hunger.</p>
            <p>“What <hi rend="italics">you</hi> t'ink of dis matter Josh?” demanded Simon,<lb/>  
whose skull having the well-known density of his race, did<lb/>  
not let internal ideas out, or external ideas in as readily as<lb/>  
most men's. “Our young mate <hi rend="italics">was</hi> at de light-house <lb/>beyond all controwersy; and how can he be den on dat rock<lb/>  
over yonder, too?”</p>
            <p>“Dat is imposserbul,” answered Josh; “derefore I says<lb/>  
it is n't true. I surposes you know dat what is <lb/>imposserbul is n't true, Simon. Nobody can't be out yonder and<lb/>  
down here at de same time. Dat is imposserble, Simon.<lb/>  
But what I wants to intermate to you, will explain all dis<lb/>  
difficulty; and it do show de raal super'ority of a coloured<lb/>  
man over de white poperlation. Now, you mark my<lb/>  
words, cook, and be full of admiration! Jack Tier came<lb/>  
back along wid de Mexican gentle'em, in my anchor-watch,<lb/>  
dis very night! You see, in de first place, ebbery t'ing<lb/>  
come to pass in nigger's watch.”</p>
            <p>Here the two dark-skinned worthies haw-haw'd to their<lb/>  
heart's content; laughing very much as a magistrate or a<lb/>  
minister of the gospel might be fancied to laugh, the first<lb/>  
time he saw a clown at a circus. The merriment of a <lb/>negro will have its course, in spite of ghosts, or of anything<lb/>  
else; and neither the cook nor the steward dreamed of <lb/>puting in another syllable, until their laugh was fairly and duly<lb/>  
ended. Then the cook made his remarks.</p>
            <p>“How Jack Tier comin' back explain der differculty,<lb/>  
Josh?” asked Simon.</p>
            <p>“Did n't Jack go away wid Miss Rose and de mate, in<lb/>  
de boat dat got adrift, you know, in Jack's watch on<lb/>  
deck?”</p>
            <p>Here the negroes laughed again, their imaginations <lb/>happening to picture to each, at the same instant, the <lb/>mystification about the boat; Biddy having told Josh in <lb/>confidence, the manner in which the party had returned to the<lb/>  
brig, while he and Simon were asleep; which fact the <lb/>steward had already communicated to the cook. To these two<lb/>  
beings, of an order in nature different from all around<lb/>
               <pb n="131"/>  
them, and of a simplicity and of habits that scarce placed<lb/>  
them on a level with the intelligence of the humblest white<lb/>  
man, all these circumstances had a sort of mysterious <lb/>connection, out of which peeped much the most <lb/>conspicuously to their faculties, the absurdity of the captain's imagining<lb/>  
that a boat had got adrift, which had, in truth, been taken<lb/>  
away by human hands. Accordingly, they laughed it out;<lb/>  
and when they had done laughing, they returned again to<lb/>  
the matter before them with renewed interest in the <lb/>subject.</p>
            <p>“Well, how all dat explain dis differculty?” repeated<lb/>  
Simon.</p>
            <p>“In dis wery manner, cook,” returned the steward, with<lb/>  
a little dignity in his manner. “Ebbery t'ing depend on<lb/>  
understandin', I s'pose you know. If Mr. Mulford got<lb/>  
taken off dat rock by Miss Rose and Jack Tier, wid de<lb/>  
boat, and den dey comes here altogedder; and den Jack<lb/>  
Tier, he get on board and tell Biddy all dis matter, and<lb/>  
den Biddy tell Josh, and den Josh tell de cook—what for<lb/>  
you surprise, you black debbil, one bit?”</p>
            <p>“Dat all!” exclaimed Simon.</p>
            <p>“Dat just all—dat ebbery bit of it, do n't I say.”</p>
            <p>Here Simon burst into such a fit of loud laughter, that<lb/>  
it induced Spike himself to shove aside the galley-door,<lb/>  
and thrust his own frowning visage into the dark hole <lb/>within, to inquire the cause.</p>
            <p>“What's the meaning of this uproar?” demanded the<lb/>  
captain, all the more excited because he felt that things<lb/>  
had reached a pass that would not permit him to laugh<lb/>  
himself. “Do you fancy yourself on the Hook, or at the<lb/>  
Five Points?”</p>
            <p>The Hook and the Five Points are two pieces of tabooed<lb/>  
territory within the limits of the good town of Manhattan,<lb/>  
that are getting to be renowned for their rascality and <lb/>orgies. They probably want nothing but the proclamation<lb/>  
of a governor in vindication of their principles, annexed to<lb/>  
a pardon of some of their unfortunate children, to render<lb/>  
both classical. If we continue to make much further <lb/>progress in political logic, and in the same direction as that<lb/>  
in which we have already proceeded so far, neither will<lb/>  
probably long be in want of this illustration. Votes can<lb/>
               <pb n="132"/>  
be given by the virtuous citizens of both these purlieus, as<lb/>  
well as by the virtuous citizens of the anti-rent districts,<lb/>  
and votes contain the essence of all such principles, as well<lb/>  
as of their glorification.</p>
            <p>“Do you fancy yourselves on the Hook, or at the Five<lb/>  
Points?” demanded Spike, angrily.</p>
            <p>“Lor', no sir!” answered Simon, laughing at each pause<lb/>  
with all his heart. “Only laughs a little at <hi rend="italics">ghost</hi>—dat<lb/>  
all, sir.”</p>
            <p>“Laugh at ghost! Is that a subject to laugh at? Have<lb/>  
a care, you black rascal, or he will visit you in your galley<lb/>  
here, when you will least want to see him.”</p>
            <p>“No care much for <hi rend="italics">him,</hi> sir,” returned Simon, laughing<lb/>  
away as hard as ever. “<hi rend="italics">Sich</hi> a ghost ought n't to skear<lb/>  
little baby.”</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="italics">Such</hi> a ghost? And what do you know of <hi rend="italics">this</hi> ghost<lb/>  
more than any other?”</p>
            <p>“Well, I seed him, Cap'in Spike; and what a body sees,<lb/>  
he is acquainted wid.”</p>
            <p>“You saw an image that looked as much like Mr. <lb/>Mulford, my late mate, as one timber-head in this brig is like<lb/>  
another.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, sir, he like enough—must say <hi rend="italics">dat</hi>—so wery like,<lb/>  
could n't see any difference.”</p>
            <p>As Simon concluded this remark, he burst out into <lb/>another fit of laughter, in which Josh joined him, heart and<lb/>  
soul, as it might be. The uninitiated reader is not to <lb/>imagine the laughter of those blacks to be very noisy, or to be<lb/>  
raised on a sharp, high key. They <hi rend="italics">could</hi> make the welkin<lb/>  
ring, in sudden bursts of merriment, on occasion; but, at a<lb/>  
time like this, they rather caused their diversion to be <lb/>developed by sounds that came from the depths of their<lb/>  
chests. A gleam of suspicion that these blacks were <lb/>acquainted with some fact that it might be well for him to<lb/>  
know, shot across the mind of Spike; but he was turned<lb/>  
from further inquiry by a remark of Don Juan, who <lb/>intimated that the mirth of such persons never had much<lb/>  
meaning to it, expressing at the same time a desire to <lb/>pursue the more important subject in which they were engaged.<lb/>  
Admonishing the blacks to be more guarded in their <lb/>manifestations of merriment, the captain closed the door on<lb/>
               <pb n="133"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
them, and resumed his walk up and down the quarter-deck.<lb/>  
As soon as left to themselves, the blacks broke out afresh,<lb/>  
though in a way so guarded, as to confine their mirth to<lb/>  
the galley.</p>
            <p>“Cap'in Spike t'ink <hi rend="italics">dat</hi> a ghost!” exclaimed Simon,<lb/>  
with contempt.</p>
            <p>“Guess if he see <hi rend="italics">raal</hi> ghost, he find 'e difference,” <lb/>answered Josh. “One look at raal sperit wort' two at dis<lb/>  
object.”</p>
            <p>Simon's eyes now opened like two saucers, and they<lb/>  
gleamed, by the light of the lamp they had, like dark balls<lb/>  
of condensed curiosity, blended with awe, on his <lb/>companion.</p>
            <p>“You ebber see him, Josh?” he asked, glancing over<lb/>  
each shoulder hurriedly, as it might be, to make sure that<lb/>  
he could not see “him,” too.</p>
            <p>“How you t'ink I get so far down the wale of life, Simon,<lb/>  
and nebber see sich a t'ing? I seed t'ree of the crew of the<lb/>  
‘Maria Sheffington,’ that was drowned by deir boat's <lb/>capsizin', when we lay at Gibraltar, jest as plain as I see you<lb/>  
now. Then—”</p>
            <p>But it is unnecessary to repeat Josh's experiences in this<lb/>  
way, with which he continued to entertain and terrify <lb/>Simon for the next half-hour. This is just the difference <lb/>between ignorance and knowledge. While Spike himself,<lb/>  
and every man in his brig who belonged forward, had<lb/>  
strong misgivings as to the earthly character of the figure<lb/>  
they had seen at the foot of the light-house, these negroes<lb/>  
laughed at their delusion, because they happened to be in<lb/>  
the secret of Mulford's escape from the rock, and of that<lb/>  
of his actual presence at the Tortugas. When, however,<lb/>  
the same superstitious feeling was brought to bear on <lb/>circumstances that lay <hi rend="italics">without</hi> the sphere of their exact <lb/>information, they became just as dependent and helpless as all<lb/>  
around them; more so, indeed, inasmuch as their previous<lb/>  
habits and opinions disposed them to a more profound <lb/>credulity.</p>
            <p>It was midnight before any of the crew of the Swash<lb/>  
sought their rest that night. The captain had to remind<lb/>  
them that a day of extraordinary toil was before them, ere<lb/>  
he could get one even to quit the deck; and when they did<lb/>
               <pb n="134"/>  
go below, it was to continue to discuss the subject of what<lb/>  
they had seen at the Dry Tortugas. It appeared to be the<lb/>  
prevalent opinion among the people, that the late event<lb/>  
foreboded evil to the Swash, and long as most of these men<lb/>  
had served in the brig, and much as they had become <lb/>attached to her, had she gone into port that night, nearly<lb/>  
every man forward would have run before morning. But<lb/>  
fatigue and wonder, at length, produced their effect, and<lb/>  
the vessel was silent as was usual at that hour. Spike <lb/>himself lay down in his clothes, as he had done ever since<lb/>  
Mulford had left him; and the brig continued to toss the<lb/>  
spray from her bows, as she bore gallantly up against the<lb/>  
trades, working her way to windward. The light was<lb/>  
found to be of great service, as it indicated the position of<lb/>  
the reef, though it gradually sunk in the western horizon,<lb/>  
until near morning it fell entirely below it.</p>
            <p>At this hour Spike appeared on deck again, where, for<lb/>  
the first time since their interview on the morning of <lb/>Harry's and Rose's escape, he laid his eyes on Jack Tier.<lb/>  
The little dumpling-looking fellow was standing in the<lb/>  
waist, with his arms folded sailor-fashion, as composedly as<lb/>  
if nothing had occurred to render his meeting with the <lb/>captain any way of a doubtful character. Spike approached<lb/>  
near the person of the steward, whom he surveyed from<lb/>  
head to foot, with a sort of contemptuous superiority, ere<lb/>  
he spoke.</p>
            <p>“So, Master Tier,” at length the captain commenced,<lb/>  
“you have deigned to turn out at last, have you? I hope<lb/>  
the day's duty you've forgotten, will help to pay for the<lb/>  
light-house boat, that I understand you've lost for me,<lb/>  
also.”</p>
            <p>“What signifies a great clumsy boat that the brig<lb/>  
could n't hoist in nor tow,” answered Jack, coolly, turning<lb/>  
short round at the same time, but not condescending to<lb/>  
“uncoil” his arms as he did so, a mark of indifference that<lb/>  
would probably have helped to mystify the captain, had he<lb/>  
even actually suspected that anything was wrong beyond<lb/>  
the supposed accident to the boat in question. “If you<lb/>  
had had the boat astarn, Captain Spike, an order would<lb/>  
have been given to cut it adrift the first time the brig made<lb/>  
sail on the wind.”</p>
            <pb n="135"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“Nobody knows, Jack; that boat would have been very<lb/>  
useful to us while at work about the wreck. You never<lb/>  
even turned out this morning to let me know where that<lb/>  
craft lay, as you promised to do, but left us to find it out<lb/>  
by our wits.”</p>
            <p>“There was no occasion for my tellin' you anything<lb/>  
about it, sir, when the mast-heads was to be seen above<lb/>  
water. As soon as I heard that them 'ere mast-heads was<lb/>  
out of water, I turned over and went to sleep upon it. A<lb/>  
man can't be on the doctor's list and on duty at the same<lb/>  
time.”</p>
            <p>Spike looked hard at the little steward, but he made no<lb/>  
further allusion to his being off duty, or to his failing to<lb/>  
stand pilot to the brig as she came through the passage in<lb/>  
quest of the schooner's remains. The fact was, that he<lb/>  
had discovered the mast-heads himself, just as he was on<lb/>  
the point of ordering Jack to be called, having allowed him<lb/>  
to remain in his berth to the last moment after his watch,<lb/>  
according to a species of implied faith that is seldom <lb/>disregarded among seamen. Once busied on the wreck, Jack<lb/>  
was forgotten, having little to do in common with any one<lb/>  
on board, but that which the captain termed the “women's<lb/>  
mess.”</p>
            <p>“Come aft, Jack,” resumed Spike, after a considerable<lb/>  
pause, during the whole of which he had stood regarding<lb/>  
the little steward as if studying his person, and through<lb/>  
that his character. “Come aft to the trunk; I wish to<lb/>  
catechise you a bit.”</p>
            <p>“Catechise!” repeated Tier, in an under tone, as he<lb/>  
followed the captain to the place mentioned. “It's a long<lb/>  
time since I've done anything at <hi rend="italics">that!</hi>”</p>
            <p>“Ay, come hither,” resumed Spike, seating himself at<lb/>  
his ease on the trunk, while Jack stood near by, his arms<lb/>  
still folded, and his rotund little form as immovable, under<lb/>  
the plunges that the lively brig made into the head-seas<lb/>  
that she was obliged to meet, as if a timber-head in the<lb/>  
vessel itself. “You keep your sea-legs well, Jack, short<lb/>  
as they are.”</p>
            <p>“No wonder for that, Captain Spike; for the last twenty<lb/>  
years I've scarce passed a twelvemonth ashore; and what<lb/>
               <pb n="136"/>  
I did before that, no one can better tell than yourself, since<lb/>  
we was ten good years shipmates.”</p>
            <p>“So you say, Jack, though I do not remember <hi rend="italics">you</hi> as<lb/>  
well as you seem to remember <hi rend="italics">me</hi>. Do you not make the<lb/>  
time too long?”</p>
            <p>“Not a day, sir. Ten good and happy years did we<lb/>  
sail together, Captain Spike; and all that time in this<lb/>  
very—”</p>
            <p>“Hush—h-u-s-h, man, hush! There is no need of <lb/>telling the Molly's age to everybody. I may wish to sell her<lb/>  
some day, and then her great experience will be no <lb/>recommendation. You should recollect that the Molly is a <lb/>female, and the ladies do not like to hear of their ages after<lb/>  
five-and-twenty.”</p>
            <p>Jack made no answer, but he dropped his arms to their<lb/>  
natural position, seeming to wait the captain's <lb/>communication, first referring to his tobacco-box and taking a fresh<lb/>  
quid.</p>
            <p>“If you was with me in the brig, Jack, at the time you<lb/>  
mention,” continued Spike, after another long and <lb/>thoughtful pause, “you must remember many little things that I<lb/>  
do n't wish to have known; especially while Mrs. Budd<lb/>  
and her handsome niece is aboard here.”</p>
            <p>“I understand you, Captain Spike. The ladies shall<lb/>  
l'arn no more from me than they know already.”</p>
            <p>“Thank 'e for that Jack—thank 'e with all my heart<lb/>  
Shipmates of our standing ought to be fast friends; and so<lb/>  
you'll find me, if you'll only sail under the true colours,<lb/>  
my man.”</p>
            <p>At that moment Jack longed to let the captain know how<lb/>  
strenuously he had insisted that very night on rejoining his<lb/>  
vessel; and this at a time, too, when the brig was falling<lb/>  
into disrepute. But this he could not do, without betraying<lb/>  
the secret of the lovers—so he chose to say nothing.</p>
            <p>“There is no use in blabbing all a man knows, and the<lb/>  
galley is a sad place for talking. Galley news is poor news,<lb/>  
I suppose you know, Jack.”</p>
            <p>“I've hear'n say as much on board o' man-of-war. It's<lb/>  
a great place for the officers to meet and talk, and smoke,<lb/>  
in Uncle Sam's crafts; and what a body hears in such<lb/>  
places, is pretty much newspaper stuff, I do suppose.”</p>
            <pb n="137"/>
            <p/>
            <milestone unit="collation"/>
            <p>“Ay, ay, that's it; not to be thought of half-an-hour<lb/>  
after it has been spoken. Here's a doubloon for you,<lb/>  
Jack; and all for the sake of old times. Now, tell me, my<lb/>  
litle fellow, how do the ladies come on? Does n't Miss<lb/>  
Rose get over her mourning on account of the mate?<lb/>  
Ar' n't we to have the pleasure of seein' her on deck soon?”</p>
            <p>“I can't answer for the minds and fancies of young<lb/>  
women, Captain Spike. They are difficult to understand;<lb/>  
and I would rather not meddle with what I can't <lb/>understand.”</p>
            <p>“Poh, poh, man; you must get over that. You might<lb/>  
be of great use to me, Jack, in a very delicate affair—for<lb/>  
you know how it is with women; they must be handled as<lb/>  
a man would handle this brig among breakers; Rose, in<lb/>  
partic'lar, is as skittish as a colt.”</p>
            <p>“Stephen Spike,” said Jack, solemnly, but on so low a<lb/>  
key that it entirely changed his usually harsh and cracked<lb/>  
voice to one that sounded soft, if not absolutely pleasant,<lb/>  
“do you never think of hereafter? Your days are almost<lb/>  
run; a very few years, in your calling it may be a very few<lb/>  
weeks, or a few hours, and time will be done with you, and<lb/>  
etarnity will commence.—Do you never think of a <lb/>hereafter?”</p>
            <p>Spike started to his feet, gazing at Jack intently; then<lb/>  
he wiped the perspiration from his face, and began to pace<lb/>  
the deck rapidly, muttering to himself—“this has been a<lb/>  
most accursed night! First the mate, and now <hi rend="italics">this!</hi> Blast<lb/>  
me, but I thought it was a voice from the grave! Graves!<lb/>  
can't they keep those that belong to them, or have rocks<lb/>  
and waves no graves?”</p>
            <p>What more passed through the mind of the captain must<lb/>  
remain a secret, for he kept it to himself; nor did he take<lb/>  
any further notice of his companion. Jack, finding that<lb/>  
he was unobserved, passed quietly below, and took the<lb/>  
place in his berth, which he had only temporarily <lb/>abandoned.</p>
            <p>Just as the day dawned, the Swash reached the vicinity<lb/>  
of the wreck again. Sail was shortened, and the brig stood<lb/>  
in until near enough for the purpose of her commander,<lb/>  
when she was hove-to, so near the mast-heads that, by <lb/>lowering the yawl, a line was sent out to the fore-mast, and the<lb/>
               <pb n="138"/>  
brig was hauled close alongside. The direction of the reef<lb/>  
at that point formed a lee; and the vessel lay in water <lb/>sufficiently smooth for her object.</p>
            <p>This was done soon after the sun had risen, and Spike<lb/>  
now ordered all hands called, and began his operations in<lb/>  
earnest. By sounding carefully around the schooner when<lb/>  
last here, he had ascertained her situation to his entire <lb/>satisfaction. She had settled on a shelf of the reef, in such<lb/>  
a position that her bows lay in a sort of cradle, while her<lb/>  
stern was several feet nearer to the surface than the <lb/>opposite extremity. This last fact was apparent, indeed, by<lb/>  
the masts themselves, the lower mast aft being several feet<lb/>  
out of water, while the fore-mast was entirely buried, <lb/>leaving nothing but the fore-topmast exposed. On these great<lb/>  
premises Spike had laid the foundation of the practical<lb/>  
problem he intended to solve.</p>
            <p>No expectation existed of ever getting the schooner<lb/>  
afloat again. All that Spike and the Señor Montefalderon<lb/>  
now aimed at, was to obtain the doubloons, which the <lb/>former thought could be got at in the following manner. He<lb/>  
knew that it would be much easier handling the wreck, so<lb/>  
far as its gravity was concerned, while the hull continued<lb/>  
submerged. He also knew that one end could be raised<lb/>  
with a comparatively trifling effort, so long as the other<lb/>  
rested on the rock. Under these circumstances, therefore,<lb/>  
he proposed merely to get slings around the after body of<lb/>  
the schooner, as near her stern-post, indeed, as would be<lb/>  
safe, and to raise that extremity of the vessel to the surface,<lb/>  
leaving most of the weight of the craft to rest on the bows.<lb/>  
The difference between the power necessary to effect this<lb/>  
much, and that which would be required to raise the whole<lb/>  
wreck, would be like the difference in power necessary to<lb/>  
turn over a log with one end resting on the ground, and<lb/>  
turning the same log by lifting it bodily in the arms, and<lb/>  
turning it in the air. With the stern once above water, it<lb/>  
would be easy to come at the bag of doubloons, which Jack<lb/>  
Tier had placed in a locker above the transoms.</p>
            <p>The first thing was to secure the brig properly, in order<lb/>  
that she might bear the necessary strain. This was done<lb/>  
very much as has been described already, in the account<lb/>  
of the manner in which she was secured and supported in<lb/>
               <pb n="139"/>  
order to raise the schooner at the Dry Tortugas. An <lb/>anchor was laid abreast and to windward, and purchases were<lb/>  
brought to the masts, as before. Then the bight of the<lb/>  
chain brought from the Tortugas, was brought under the<lb/>  
schooner's keel, and counter-purchases, leading from both<lb/>  
the fore-mast and main-mast of the brig, were brought to it,<lb/>  
and set taut. Spike now carefully examined all his <lb/>fastenings, looking to his cables as well as his mechanical power<lb/>  
aloft, heaving in upon this, and veering out upon that, in<lb/>  
order to bring the Molly square to her work; after which<lb/>  
he ordered the people to knock-off for their dinners. By<lb/>  
that time, it was high noon.</p>
            <p>While Stephen Spike was thus employed on the wreck,<lb/>  
matters and things were not neglected at the Tortugas.<lb/>  
The Poughkeepsie had no sooner anchored, than Wallace<lb/>  
went on board and made his report. Capt. Mull then sent<lb/>  
for Mulford, with whom he had a long personal conference.<lb/>  
This officer was getting grey, and consequently he had <lb/>acquired experience. It was evident to Harry, at first, that<lb/>  
he was regarded as one who had been willingly engaged in<lb/>  
an unlawful pursuit, but who had abandoned it to push<lb/>  
dearer interests in another quarter. It was some time <lb/>before the commander of the sloop-of-war could divest <lb/>himself of this opinion, though it gradually gave way before the<lb/>  
frankness of the mate's manner, and the manliness, <lb/>simplicity, and justice of his sentiments. Perhaps Rose had<lb/>  
some influence also in bringing about this favourable change.</p>
            <p>Wallace did not fail to let it be known that turtle-soup<lb/>  
was to be had ashore; and many was the guest our heroine<lb/>  
had to supply with that agreeable compound, in the course<lb/>  
of the morning. Jack Tier had manifested so much skill<lb/>  
in the preparation of the dish, that its reputation soon <lb/>extended to the cabin, and the captain was induced to land,<lb/>  
in order to ascertain how far rumour was or was not a liar,<lb/>  
on this interesting occasion. So ample was the custom,<lb/>  
indeed, that Wallace had the consideration to send one of<lb/>  
the ward-room servants to the light-house, in order to <lb/>relieve Rose from a duty that was getting to be a little <lb/>irksome. She was “seeing company” as a bride, in a novel<lb/>  
and rather unpleasant manner; and it was in consequence<lb/>  
of a suggestion of the “ship's gentleman,” that the remains<lb/>
               <pb n="140"/>  
of the turtle were transferred to the vessel, and were put<lb/>  
into the coppers, <hi rend="italics">secundum artem,</hi> by the regular cooks.</p>
            <p>It was after tickling his palate with a bowl of the soup,<lb/>  
and enjoying a half-hour's conversation with Rose, that<lb/>  
Capt. Mull summoned Harry to a final consultation on the<lb/>  
subject of their future proceedings. By this time the <lb/>commander of the Poughkeepsie was in a better humour with<lb/>  
his new acquaintance, more disposed to believe him, and<lb/>  
infinitely more inclined to listen to his suggestions and <lb/>advice, than he had been in their previous interviews. <lb/>Wallace was present in his character of “ship's gentleman,”<lb/>  
or, as having nothing to do, while his senior, the first <lb/>lieutenant, was working like a horse on board the vessel, in the<lb/>  
execution of his round of daily duties.</p>
            <p>At this consultation, the parties came into a right <lb/>understanding of each other's views and characters. Capt. Mull<lb/>  
was slow to yield his confidence, but when he did bestow<lb/>  
it, he bestowed it sailor-fashion, or with all his heart. <lb/>Satisfied at last that he had to do with a young man of <lb/>honour, and one who was true to the flag, he consulted freely<lb/>  
with our mate, asked his advice, and was greatly <lb/>influenced in the formation of his final decision by the opinions<lb/>  
that Harry modestly advanced, maintaining them, however,<lb/>  
with solid arguments, and reasons that every seaman could<lb/>  
comprehend.</p>
            <p>Mulford knew the plans of Spike by means of his own<lb/>  
communications with the Señor Montefalderon. Once <lb/>acquainted with the projects of his old commander, it was<lb/>  
easy for him to calculate the time it would require to put<lb/>  
them in execution, with the means that were to be found<lb/>  
on board the Swash. “It will take the brig until near<lb/>  
morning,” he said, “to beat up to the place where the<lb/>  
wreck lies. Spike will wait for light to commence <lb/>operations, and several hours will be necessary to moor the brig,<lb/>  
and get out the anchors with which he will think it <lb/>necessary to stay his masts. Then he will hook on, and he may<lb/>  
partly raise the hull before night return. More than this<lb/>  
he can never do; and it would not surprise me were he<lb/>  
merely to get everything ready for heaving on his purchases<lb/>  
to-morrow, and suspend further proceedings until the next<lb/>  
day, in preference to having so heavy a strain on his spars<lb/>
               <pb n="141"/>  
all night. He has not the force, however, to carry on such<lb/>  
duty to a very late hour; and you may count with perfect<lb/>  
security, Captain Mull, on his being found alongside of the<lb/>  
wreck at sunrise the next day after to-morrow, in all <lb/>probability with his anchors down, and fast to the wreck. By<lb/>  
timing your own arrival well, nothing will be easier than to<lb/>  
get him fairly under your guns, and once under your guns,<lb/>  
the brig must give up. When you chased her out of this<lb/>  
very port, a few days since, you would have brought her<lb/>  
up could you have kept her within range of those terrible<lb/>  
shells ten minutes longer.”</p>
            <p>“You would then advise my not sailing from this place<lb/>  
immediately,” said Mull.</p>
            <p>“It will be quite time enough to get under way late in<lb/>  
the afternoon, and then under short canvas. Ten hours<lb/>  
will be ample time for this ship to beat up to that passage<lb/>  
in, and it will be imprudent to arrive too soon; nor do I<lb/>  
suppose you will wish to be playing round the reef in the<lb/>  
dark.”</p>
            <p>To the justice of all this Capt. Mull assented; and the<lb/>  
plan of proceedings was deliberately and intelligently <lb/>formed. As it was necessary for Mulford to go in the ship, in<lb/>  
order to act as pilot, no one else on board knowing exactly<lb/>  
where to find the wreck, the commander of the <lb/>Poughkeepsie had the civility to offer the young couple the <lb/>hospitalities of his own cabin, with one of his state-rooms.<lb/>  
This offer Harry gratefully accepted, it being understood<lb/>  
that the ship would land them at Key West, as soon as the<lb/>  
contemplated duty was executed. Rose felt so much <lb/>anxiety about her aunt, that any other arrangement would<lb/>  
scarcely have pacified her fears.</p>
            <p>In consequence of these arrangements, the <lb/>Poughkeepsie lay quietly at her anchors until near sunset. In the <lb/>interval her boats were out in all directions, parties of the<lb/>  
officers visiting the islet where the powder had exploded,<lb/>  
and the islet where the tent, erected for the use of the <lb/>females, was still standing. As for the light-house island, an<lb/>  
order of Capt. Mull's prevented it from being crowded in<lb/>  
a manner unpleasant to Rose, as might otherwise have been<lb/>  
the case. The few officers who did land there, however,<lb/>  
appeared much struck with the ingenuous simplicity and<lb/>
               <pb n="142"/>  
beauty of the bride, and a manly interest in her welfare<lb/>  
was created among them all, principally by means of the<lb/>  
representations of the second lieutenant and the chaplain.<lb/>  
About five o'clock she went off to the ship, accompanied<lb/>  
by Harry, and was hoisted on board in the manner usually<lb/>  
practised by vessels of war which have no <lb/>accommodation-ladder rigged. Rose was immediately installed in her<lb/>  
state-room, where she found every convenience necessary<lb/>  
to a comfortable though small apartment.</p>
            <p>It was quite late in the afternoon, when the boatswain<lb/>  
and his mate piped “all hands up anchor,!” Harry<lb/>  
hastened into the state-room for his charming bride, <lb/>anxious to show her the movements of a vessel of war on such<lb/>  
an occasion. Much as she had seen of the ocean, and of<lb/>  
a vessel, within the last few weeks, Rose now found that<lb/>  
she had yet a great deal to learn, and that a ship of war<lb/>  
had many points to distinguish her from a vessel engaged<lb/>  
in commerce.</p>
            <p>The Poughkeepsie was only a sloop-of-war, or a corvette,<lb/>  
in construction, number of her guns, and rate; but she<lb/>  
was a ship of the dimensions of an old-fashioned frigate,<lb/>  
measuring about one thousand tons. The frigates of which<lb/>  
we read half a century since, were seldom ever as large as<lb/>  
this, though they were differently built in having a regular<lb/>  
gun-deck, or one armed deck that was entirely covered,<lb/>  
with another above it; and on the quarter-deck and <lb/>forecastle of the last of which were also batteries of lighter<lb/>  
guns. To the contrary of all this, the Poughkeepsie had<lb/>  
but one armed deck, and on that only twenty guns. These<lb/>  
pieces, however, were of unusually heavy calibre, throwing<lb/>  
thirty-two pound shot, with the exception of the Paixhans,<lb/>  
or Columbiads, which throw shot of even twice that weight.<lb/>  
The vessel had a crew of two hundred souls, all told; and<lb/>  
she had the spars, anchors, and other equipments of a light<lb/>  
frigate.</p>
            <p>In another great particular did the Poughkeepsie differ<lb/>  
from the corvette-built vessels that were so much in favour<lb/>  
at the beginning of the century; a species of craft obtained<lb/>  
from the French, who have taught the world so much in<lb/>  
connection with naval science, and who, after building<lb/>  
some of the best vessels that ever floated, have failed in<lb/>
               <pb n="143"/>  
knowing how to handle them, though not always in that.<lb/>  
The Poughkeepsie, while she had no spar, or upper deck,<lb/>  
properly speaking, had a poop and a topgallant-forecastle.<lb/>  
Within the last were the cabins and other accommodations<lb/>  
of the captain; an arrangement that was necessary for a<lb/>  
craft of her construction, that carried so many officers, and<lb/>  
so large a crew. Without it, sufficient space would not be<lb/>  
had for the uses of the last. One gun of a side was in the<lb/>  
main cabin, there being a very neat and amply spacious<lb/>  
after-cabin between the state-rooms, as is ordinarily the<lb/>  
case in all vessels from the size of frigates up to that of<lb/>  
three-deckers. It may be well to explain here, while on<lb/>  
this subject of construction, that in naval parlance, a ship<lb/>  
is called a single-decked vessel; a <hi rend="italics">two-</hi>decker, or a <hi rend="italics">three-  
 </hi>
               <lb/>decker, not from the number of decks she actually <lb/>possesses, but from the number of <hi rend="italics">gun-</hi>decks that she has, or of<lb/>  
those that are <hi rend="italics">fully</hi> armed. Thus a frigate has four decks,<lb/>  
the spar, gun, berth, and orlop (or haul-up) decks; but she<lb/>  
is called a “single-decked ship,” from the circumstance<lb/>  
that only one of these four decks has a complete range of<lb/>  
batteries. The two-decker has two of these fully armed<lb/>  
decks, and the three-deckers three; though, in fact, the<lb/>  
two-decker has five, and the three-decker six decks. <lb/>Asking pardon for this little digression, which we trust will be<lb/>  
found useful to a portion of our readers, we return to the<lb/>  
narrative.</p>
            <p>Harry conducted Rose to the poop of the Poughkeepsie,<lb/>  
where she might enjoy the best view of the operation of<lb/>  
getting so large a craft under way, man-of-war fashion.<lb/>  
The details were mysteries, of course, and Rose knew no<lb/>  
more of the process by which the chain was brought to the<lb/>  
capstan, by the intervention of what is called a messenger,<lb/>  
than if she had not been present. She saw two hundred<lb/>  
men distributed about the vessel, some at the capstan, some<lb/>  
on the forecastle, some in the tops, and others in the waist,<lb/>  
and she heard the order to “heave round.” Then the shrill<lb/>  
fife commenced the lively air of “the girl I left behind<lb/>  
me,” rather more from a habit in the fifer, than from any<lb/>  
great regrets for the girls left at the Dry Tortugas, as was<lb/>  
betrayed to Mulford by the smiles of the officers, and the<lb/>  
glances they cast at Rose. As for the latter, she knew <lb/>
               <pb n="144"/>nothing of the air, and was quite unconscious of the sort of<lb/>  
parody that the gentlemen of the quarter-deck fancied it<lb/>  
conveyed on her own situation.</p>
            <p>Rose was principally struck with the quiet that prevailed<lb/>  
in the ship, Captain Mull being a silent man himself, and<lb/>  
insisting on having a quiet vessel. The first lieutenant<lb/>  
was not a noisy officer, and from these two, everybody else<lb/>  
on board received their cues. A simple “all ready, sir,”<lb/>  
uttered by the first to the captain, in a common tone of<lb/>  
voice, answered by a “very well, sir, get your anchor,”<lb/>  
in the same tone, set everything in motion. “Stamp and<lb/>  
go,” soon followed, and taking the whole scene together,<lb/>  
Rose felt a strange excitement come over her. There<lb/>  
were the shrill, animating music of the fife; the stamping<lb/>  
time of the men at the bars; the perceptible motion of the<lb/>  
ship, as she drew ahead to her anchor, and now and then<lb/>  
the call between Wallace, who stood between the <lb/>knight-heads, as commander-in-chief on the forecastle, (the second<lb/>  
lieutenant's station when the captain does not take the<lb/>  
trumpet, as very rarely happens,) and the “executive <lb/>officer” aft, was “carrying on duty,” all conspiring to produce<lb/>  
this effect. At length, and it was but a minute or two from<lb/>  
the time when the “stamp and go” commenced, Wallace<lb/>  
called out “a short stay-peak, sir.” “Heave and pull,”<lb/>  
followed, and the men left their bars.</p>
            <p>The process of making sail succeeded. There was no<lb/>  
“letting fall” a fore-topsail here, as on board a <lb/>merchantman, but all the canvas dropped from the yards, into <lb/>festoons, at the same instant. Then the three topsails were<lb/>  
sheeted home and hoisted, all at once, and all in a single<lb/>  
minute of time; the yards were counter-braced, and the<lb/>  
capstan-bars were again manned. In two more minutes it<lb/>  
was “heave and she's up and down.” Then “heave and<lb/>  
in sight,” and “heave and pull again.” The cat-fall was<lb/>  
ready, and it was “hook on,” when the fife seemed to turn<lb/>  
its attention to another subject as the men catted the <lb/>anchor. Literally, all this was done in less time than we<lb/>  
have taken to write it down in, and in very little more time<lb/>  
than the reader has wasted in perusing what we have here<lb/>  
written.</p>
            <p>The Poughkeepsie was now “free of bottom,” as it is<lb/>
               <pb n="145"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
called, with her anchor catted and fished, and her position<lb/>  
maintained in the basin where she lay, by the <lb/>counter-bracing of her yards, and the counteracting force of the<lb/>  
wind on her sails. It only remained to “fill away,” by<lb/>  
bracing her head-yards sharp up, when the vast mass <lb/>overcame its inertia, and began to move through the water.<lb/>  
As this was done, the jib and spanker were set. The two<lb/>  
most beautiful things with which we are acquainted, are a<lb/>  
graceful and high-bred woman entering or quitting a <lb/>drawing-room, more particularly the last, and a man-of-war <lb/>leaving her anchorage in a moderate breeze, and when not<lb/>  
hurried for time. On the present occasion, Captain Mull<lb/>  
was in no haste, and the ship passed out to windward of<lb/>  
the light, as the Swash had done the previous night, under<lb/>  
her three topsails, spanker and jib, with the light sails<lb/>  
loose and flowing, and the courses hanging in the brails.</p>
            <p>A great deal is said concerning the defective <lb/>construction of the light cruisers of the navy, of late years, and<lb/>  
complaints are made that they will not sail, as American<lb/>  
cruisers ought to sail, and were wont to sail in old times.<lb/>  
That there has been some ground for these complaints, we<lb/>  
believe; though the evil has been greatly exaggerated, and<lb/>  
some explanation may be given, we think, even in the cases<lb/>  
in which the strictures are not altogether without <lb/>justification. The trim of a light, sharp vessel is easily deranged;<lb/>  
and officers, in their desire to command as much as <lb/>possible, often get their vessels of this class too deep. They<lb/>  
are, generally, for the sort of cruiser, over-sparred, <lb/>over-manned, and over-provisioned; consequently, too deep.<lb/>  
We recollect a case in which one of these delicate craft,<lb/>  
a half-rigged brig, was much abused for “having lost her<lb/>  
sailing.” She did, indeed, lose her fore-yard, and, after that,<lb/>  
she sailed like a witch, until she got a new one! If the<lb/>  
facts were inquired into, in the spirit which ought to <lb/>govern such inquiries, it would be found that even most of<lb/>  
the much-abused “ten sloops” proved to be better <lb/>vessels than common. The St. Louis, the Vincennes, the<lb/>  
Concord, the Fairfield, the Boston, and the Falmouth, are<lb/>  
instances of what we mean. In behalf of the Warren, and<lb/>  
the Lexington, we believe no discreet man was ever heard<lb/>  
to utter one syllable, except as wholesome crafts. But the<lb/>
               <pb n="146"/>  
Poughkeepsie was a very different sort of vessel from any<lb/>  
of the “ten sloops.” She was every way a good ship, and,<lb/>  
as Jack expressed it, was “a good goer.” The most <lb/>severe nautical critic could scarcely have found a fault in<lb/>  
her, as she passed out between the islets, on the evening<lb/>  
of the day mentioned, in the sort of undress we have <lb/>described. The whole scene, indeed, was impressive, and<lb/>  
of singular maritime characteristics.</p>
            <p>The little islets scattered about, low, sandy, and <lb/>untenanted, were the only land in sight—all else was the <lb/>boundless waste of waters. The solitary light rose like an <lb/>aquatic monument, as if purposely to give its character to the<lb/>  
view. Captain Mull had caused its lamps to be trimmed<lb/>  
and lighted for the very reason that had induced Spike to<lb/>  
do the same thing, and the dim star they presented was<lb/>  
just struggling into existence, as it might be, as the <lb/>briliance left by the setting sun was gradually diminished, and<lb/>  
finally disappeared. As for the ship, the hull appeared<lb/>  
dark, glossy, and graceful, as is usual with a vessel of war.<lb/>  
Her sails were in soft contrast to the colour of the hull,<lb/>  
and they offered the variety and divergence from straight<lb/>  
lines which are thought necessary to perfect beauty.<lb/>  
Those that were set, presented the symmetry in their trim,<lb/>  
the flatness in their hoist, and the breadth that distinguish<lb/>  
a man-of-war; while those that were loose, floated in the<lb/>  
air in every wave and cloud-like swell, that we so often see<lb/>  
in light canvas that is released from the yards in a fresh<lb/>  
breeze. The ship had an undress look from this <lb/>circumstance, but it was such an undress as denotes the man or<lb/>  
woman of the world. This undress appearance was <lb/>increased by the piping down of the hammocks, which left<lb/>  
the nettings loose, and with a negligent but still knowing<lb/>  
look about them.</p>
            <p>When half a mile from the islets, the main-yard was<lb/>  
braced aback, and the maintopsail was laid to the mast.<lb/>  
As soon as the ship had lost her way, two or three boats<lb/>  
that had been towing astern, each with its boat-sitter, or<lb/>  
keeper, in it, were hauled up alongside, or to the quarters,<lb/>  
were “hooked on,” and “run up” to the whistling of the<lb/>  
call. All was done at once, and all was done in a couple<lb/>
               <pb n="147"/>  
of minutes. As soon as effected, the maintopsail was again<lb/>  
filled, and away the ship glided.</p>
            <p>Captain Mull was not in the habit of holding many <lb/>consultations with his officers. If there be wisdom in a “<lb/>multitude of counsellors,” he was of opinion it was not on<lb/>  
board a man-of-war. Napoleon is reported to have said<lb/>  
that <hi rend="italics">one</hi> bad general was better than <hi rend="italics">two</hi> good ones; <lb/>meaning that one head to an army, though of inferior quality, is<lb/>  
better than a hydra of Solomons, or Caesars. Captain Mull<lb/>  
was much of the same way of thinking, seldom troubling<lb/>  
his subordinates with anything but orders. He interfered<lb/>  
very little with “working Willy,” though he saw <lb/>effectually that he did his duty. “The ship's gentleman” might<lb/>  
enjoy his joke as much as he pleased, so long as he chose<lb/>  
his time and place with discretion, but in the captain's<lb/>  
presence joking was not tolerated, unless it were after <lb/>dinner, at his own table, and in his own cabin. Even there<lb/>  
it was not precisely such joking as took place daily, not to<lb/>  
say hourly, in the midshipmen's messes.</p>
            <p>In making up his mind as to the mode of proceeding on<lb/>  
the present occasion, therefore, Captain Mull, while he had<lb/>  
heard all that Mulford had to tell him, and had even<lb/>  
encouraged Wallace to give his opinions, made up his <lb/>decision for himself. After learning all that Harry had to <lb/>communicate, he made his own calculations as to time and<lb/>  
distance, and quietly determined to carry whole sail on the<lb/>  
ship for the next four hours. This he did as the wisest<lb/>  
course of making sure of getting to windward while he<lb/>  
could, and knowing that the vessel could be brought under<lb/>  
short canvas at any moment when it might be deemed <lb/>necessary. The light was a beacon to let him know his <lb/>distance with almost mathematical precision. It could be<lb/>  
seen so many miles at sea, each mile being estimated by so<lb/>  
many feet of elevation, and having taken that elevation, he<lb/>  
was sure of his distance from the glittering object, so long<lb/>  
as it could be seen from his own poop. It was also of use<lb/>  
by letting him know the range of the reef, though Captain<lb/>  
Mull, unlike Spike, had determined to make one leg off to<lb/>  
the northward and eastward until he had brought the light<lb/>  
nearly to the horizon, and then to make another to the<lb/>  
southward and eastward, believing that the last stretch<lb/>
               <pb n="148"/>  
would bring him to the reef, almost as far to windward as<lb/>  
he desired to be. In furtherance of this plan, the sheets<lb/>  
of the different sails were drawn home, as soon as the boats<lb/>  
were in, and the Poughkeepsie, bending a little to the<lb/>  
breeze, gallantly dashed the waves aside, as she went<lb/>  
through and over them, at a rate of not less than ten good<lb/>  
knots in the hour. As soon as all these arrangements were<lb/>  
made, the watch went below, and from that time <lb/>throughout the night, the ship offered nothing but the quiet <lb/>manner in which ordinary duty is carried on in a <lb/>well-regulated vessel of war at sea, between the hours of sun and sun.<lb/>  
Leaving the good craft to pursue her way with speed and<lb/>  
certainty, we must now return to the Swash.</p>
            <p>Captain Spike had found the mooring of his brig a much<lb/>  
more difficult task, on this occasion, than on that of his<lb/>  
former attempt to raise the schooner. Then he had to lift<lb/>  
the wreck bodily, and he knew that laying the Swash a<lb/>  
few feet further ahead or astern, could be of no great <lb/>moment, inasmuch as the moment the schooner was off the<lb/>  
bottom, she would swing in perpendicularly to the <lb/>purchases. But now one end of the schooner, her bows, was<lb/>  
to remain fast, and it became of importance to be certain<lb/>  
that the purchases were so placed as to bring the least strain<lb/>  
on the masts while they acted most directly on the after<lb/>  
body of the vessel to be lifted. This point gave Spike<lb/>  
more trouble than he had anticipated. Fully one half of<lb/>  
the remainder of the day, even after he had begun to heave<lb/>  
upon his purchases, was spent in rectifying mistakes in<lb/>  
connection with this matter, and in getting up additional<lb/>  
securities to his masts.</p>
            <p>In one respect Spike had, from the first, made a good<lb/>  
disposition. The masts of the brig raked materially, and<lb/>  
by bringing the head of the Swash in the direction of the<lb/>  
schooner, he converted this fact, which might otherwise<lb/>  
have been of great disadvantage, into a circumstance that<lb/>  
was favourable. In consequence of the brig's having been<lb/>  
thus moored, the strain, which necessarily led forward,<lb/>  
came nearly in a line with the masts, and the latter were<lb/>  
much better able to support it. Notwithstanding this <lb/>advantage, however, it was found expedient to get up <lb/>preventer-stays, and to give the spars all the additional support<lb/>
               <pb n="149"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
could be conveniently bestowed. Hours were passed in<lb/>  
making these preliminary, or it might be better to say, <lb/>secondary arrangements.</p>
            <p>It was past five in the afternoon when the people of the<lb/>  
Swash began to heave on their purchases as finally disposed.<lb/>  
After much creaking, and the settling of straps and <lb/>lashings into their places, it was found that everything stood,<lb/>  
and the work went on. In ten minutes Spike found he had<lb/>  
the weight of the schooner, so far as he should be obliged<lb/>  
to sustain it at all, until the stern rose above the surface;<lb/>  
and he felt reasonably secure of the doubloons. Further<lb/>  
than this he did not intend to make any experiment on her,<lb/>  
the Señor Montefalderon having abandoned all idea of <lb/>recovering the vessel itself, now so much of the cargo was<lb/>  
lost. The powder was mostly consumed, and that which<lb/>  
remained in the hull must, by this time, be injured by<lb/>  
dampness, if not ruined. So reasoned Don Juan at least.</p>
            <p>As the utmost care was necessary, the capstan and <lb/>windlass were made to do their several duties with great caution.<lb/>  
As inch by inch was gained, the extra supports of the<lb/>  
masts were examined, and it was found that a much <lb/>heavier strain now came on the masts than when the schooner<lb/>  
was raised before. This was altogether owing to the <lb/>direction in which it came, and to the fact that the anchor<lb/>  
planted off abeam was not of as much use as on the former<lb/>  
occasion, in consequence of its not lying so much in a<lb/>  
straight line with the direction of the purchases. Spike<lb/>  
began to have misgivings on account of his masts, and this<lb/>  
so much the more because the wind appeared to haul a little<lb/>  
further to the northward, and the weather to look unsettled.<lb/>  
Should a swell roll into the bight of the reef where the brig<lb/>  
lay, by raising the hull a little too rudely, there would be<lb/>  
the imminent danger of at least springing, if not of <lb/>absolutely carrying away both the principal spars. It was<lb/>  
therefore necessary to resort to extraordinary precautions,<lb/>  
in order to obviate this danger.</p>
            <p>The captain was indebted to his boatswain, who was now<lb/>  
in fact acting as his mate, for the suggestion of the plan<lb/>  
next adopted. Two of the largest spare spars of the brig<lb/>  
were got out, with their heads securely lashed to the links<lb/>  
of the chain by which the wreck was suspended, one on<lb/>
               <pb n="150"/>  
each side of the schooner. Pig-iron and shot were lashed<lb/>  
to the heels of these spars, which carried them to the bottom.<lb/>  
As the spars were of a greater length than was necessary<lb/>  
to reach the rock, they necessarily lay at an inclination,<lb/>  
which was lessened every inch the after body of the wreck<lb/>  
was raised, thus forming props to the hull of the schooner.</p>
            <p>Spike was delighted with the success of this scheme, of<lb/>  
which he was assured by a single experiment in heaving.<lb/>  
After getting the spars well planted at their heels, he even<lb/>  
ordered the men to slacken the purchases a little, and<lb/>  
found that he could actually relieve the brig from the strain,<lb/>  
by causing the wreck to be supported altogether by these<lb/>  
shores. This was a vast relief from the cares of the <lb/>approaching night, and indeed alone prevented the necessity<lb/>  
of the work's going on without interruption, or rest, until<lb/>  
the end was obtained.</p>
            <p>The people of the Swash were just assured of the <lb/>comfortable fact related, as the Poughkeepsie was passing out<lb/>  
from among the islets of the Dry Tortugas. They <lb/>imagined themselves happy in having thus made a sufficient<lb/>  
provision against the most formidable of all the dangers<lb/>  
that beset them, at the very moment when the best laid<lb/>  
plan for their destruction was on the point of being <lb/>executed. In this respect, they resembled millions of others of<lb/>  
their fellows, who hang suspended over the vast abyss of<lb/>  
eternity, totally unconscious of the irretrievable character<lb/>  
of the fall that is so soon to occur. Spike, as has been<lb/>  
just stated, was highly pleased with his own expedient, and<lb/>  
he pointed it out with exultation to the Señor <lb/>Montefalderon, as soon as it was completed.</p>
            <p>“A nicer fit was never made by a Lunnun leg-maker,<lb/>  
Don Wan,” the captain cried, after going over the <lb/>explanations connected with the shores—“there she stands, at<lb/>  
an angle of fifty, with two as good limbs under her as a<lb/>  
body could wish. I could now cast off everything, and<lb/>  
leave the wreck in what they call ‘<hi rend="italics">statu quo,</hi>’ which, I <lb/>suppose, means on its pins, like a statue. The tafferel is not<lb/>  
six inches below the surface of the water, and half an hour<lb/>  
of heaving will bring the starn in sight.”</p>
            <p>“Your work seems ingeniously contrived to get up one<lb/>  
extremity of the vessel, Don Esteban,” returned the <lb/>
               <pb n="151"/>Mexican; but are you quite certain that the doubloons are in<lb/>  
her?”</p>
            <p>This question was put because the functionary of a <lb/>government in which money was very apt to stick in passing<lb/>  
from hand to hand was naturally suspicious, and he found<lb/>  
it difficult to believe that Mulford, Jack Tier, and even<lb/>  
Biddy, under all the circumstances, had not paid special<lb/>  
attention to their own interests.</p>
            <p>“The bag was placed in one of the transom-lockers <lb/>before the schooner capsized,” returned the captain, “as Jack<lb/>  
Tier informs me; if so, it remains there still. Even the<lb/>  
sharks will not touch gold, Don Wan.”</p>
            <p>“Would it not be well to call Jack, and hear his account<lb/>  
of the matter once more, now we appear to be so near the<lb/>  
Eldorado of our wishes?”</p>
            <p>Spike assented, and Jack was summoned to the <lb/>quarter-deck. The little fellow had scarce showed himself <lb/>throughout the day, and he now made his appearance with a slow<lb/>  
step, and reluctantly.</p>
            <p>“You've made no mistake about them 'ere doubloons,<lb/>  
I take it, Master Tier?” said Spike, in a very nautical sort<lb/>  
of style of addressing an inferior. “You <hi rend="italics">know</hi> them to be<lb/>  
in one of the transom-lockers?”</p>
            <p>Jack mounted on the breech of one of the guns, and<lb/>  
looked over the bulwarks at the dispositions that had been<lb/>  
made about the wreck. The tafferel of the schooner <lb/>actually came in sight, when a little swell passed over it,<lb/>  
leaving it for an instant in the trough. The steward thus<lb/>  
caught a glimpse again of the craft on board which he had<lb/>  
seen so much hazard, and he shook his head and seemed<lb/>  
to be thinking of anything but the question which had just<lb/>  
been put to him.</p>
            <p>“Well, about that gold?” asked Spike, impatiently.</p>
            <p>“The sight of that craft has brought other thoughts than<lb/>  
gold into my mind, Captain Spike,” answered Jack, <lb/>gravely, “and it would be well for all us mariners, if we thought<lb/>  
less of gold and more of the dangers we run. For hours<lb/>  
and hours did I stand over etarnity, on the bottom of that<lb/>  
schooner, Don Wan, holdin' my life, as it might be, at the<lb/>  
marcy of a few bubbles of air.”</p>
            <pb n="152"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“What has all that to do with the gold? Have you <lb/>deceived me about that locker, little rascal?”</p>
            <p>“No, sir, I've <hi rend="italics">not</hi> deceived you—no, Captain Spike, <hi rend="italics">no</hi>.<lb/>  
The bag is in the upper transom-locker, on the starboard<lb/>  
side. There I put it with my own hands, and a good lift<lb/>  
it was; and there you'll find it, if you'll cut through the<lb/>  
quarter-deck at the spot I can p'int out to you.”</p>
            <p>This information seemed to give a renewed energy to all<lb/>  
the native cupidity of the captain, who called the men from<lb/>  
their suppers, and ordered them to commence heaving<lb/>  
anew. The word was passed to the crew that “it was now<lb/>  
for doubloons,” and they went to the bars and handspikes,<lb/>  
notwithstanding the sun had set, cheerfully and cheering.</p>
            <p>All Spike's expedients admirably answered the intended<lb/>  
purposes. The stern of the schooner rose gradually, and<lb/>  
at each lift the heels of the shores dropped in more <lb/>perpendicularly, carried by the weights attached to them, and the<lb/>  
spars stood as firm props to secure all that was gained. In<lb/>  
a quarter of an hour, most of that part of the stern which<lb/>  
was within five or six feet of the tafferel, rose above the<lb/>  
water, coming fairly in view.</p>
            <p>Spike now shouted to the men to “pall!” then he <lb/>directed the falls to be very gradually eased off, in order to<lb/>  
ascertain if the shores would still do their duty. The <lb/>experiment was successful, and presently the wreck stood in<lb/>  
its upright position, sustained entirely by the two spars. As<lb/>  
the last were now nearly perpendicular, they were capable<lb/>  
of bearing a very heavy weight, and Spike was so anxious<lb/>  
to relieve his own brig from the strain she had been <lb/>enduring, that he ordered the lashings of the blocks to be <lb/>loosened, trusting to his shores to do their duty. Against this<lb/>  
confidence the boatswain ventured a remonstrance, but the<lb/>  
gold was too near to allow the captain to listen or reply.<lb/>  
The carpenter was ordered over on the wreck with his<lb/>  
tools, while Spike, the Señor Montefalderon, and two men<lb/>  
to row the boat and keep it steady, went in the yawl to<lb/>  
watch the progress of the work. Jack Tier was ordered<lb/>  
to stand in the chains, and to point out, as nearly as <lb/>possible, the place where the carpenter was to cut.</p>
            <p>When all was ready, Spike gave the word, and the chips<lb/>  
began to fly. By the use of the saw and the axe, a hole<lb/>
               <pb n="153"/>  
large enough to admit two or three men at a time, was soon<lb/>  
made in the deck, and the sounding for the much-coveted<lb/>  
locker commenced. By this time, it was quite dark; and<lb/>  
a lantern was passed down from the brig, in order to enable<lb/>  
those who searched for the locker to see. Spike had<lb/>  
breasted the yawl close up to the hole, where it was held<lb/>  
by the men, while the captain himself passed the lantern<lb/>  
and his own head into the opening to reconnoitre.</p>
            <p>“Ay, it's all right!” cried the voice of the captain from<lb/>  
within his cell-like cavity. “I can just see the lid of the<lb/>  
locker that Jack means, and we shall soon have what we<lb/>  
are a'ter. Carpenter, you may as well slip off your clothes<lb/>  
at once, and go inside; I will point out to you the place<lb/>  
where to find the locker. You're certain, Jack, it was the<lb/>  
starboard locker?”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, sir, the starboard locker, and no other.”</p>
            <p>The carpenter had soon got into the hole, as naked as<lb/>  
when he was born. It was a gloomy-looking place for a<lb/>  
man to descend into at that hour, the light from the lantern<lb/>  
being no great matter, and half the time it was shaded by<lb/>  
the manner in which Spike was compelled to hold it.</p>
            <p>“Take care and get a good footing, carpenter,” said the<lb/>  
captain, in a kinder tone than common, “before you let go<lb/>  
with your hands; but I suppose you can swim, as a matter<lb/>  
of course?”</p>
            <p>“No, sir, not a stroke—I never could make out in the<lb/>  
water at all.”</p>
            <p>“Have the more 'care, then. Had I known as much, I<lb/>  
would have sent another hand down; but mind your <lb/>footing. More to the left, man—more to the left. That is<lb/>  
the lid of the locker—your hand is on it; why do you not<lb/>  
open it?”</p>
            <p>“It is swelled by the water, sir, and will need a chisel,<lb/>  
or some tool of that sort. Just call out to one of the men,<lb/>  
sir, if you please, to pass me a chisel from my tool-chest.<lb/>  
A good stout one will be best.”</p>
            <p>This order was given, and, during the delay it caused,<lb/>  
Spike encouraged the carpenter to be cool, and above all<lb/>  
to mind his footing. His own eagerness to get at the gold<lb/>  
was so great that he kept his head in at the hole, <lb/>
               <pb n="154"/>completely cutting off the man within from all communication with<lb/>  
the outer world.</p>
            <p>“What's the matter with you?” demanded Spike, a<lb/>  
little sternly. “You shiver, and yet the water cannot be<lb/>  
cold in this latitude. No, my hand makes it just the right<lb/>  
warmth to be pleasant.”</p>
            <p>“It's not the water, Captain Spike—I wish they would<lb/>  
come with the chisel. Did you hear nothing, sir? I'm<lb/>  
certain I did!”</p>
            <p>“Hear!—what is there here to be heard, unless there<lb/>  
may be some fish inside, thrashing about to get out of the<lb/>  
vessel's hold?”</p>
            <p>“I am sure I heard something like a groan, Captain<lb/>  
Spike. I wish you would let me come out, sir, and I'll go<lb/>  
for the chisel myself; them men will never find it.”</p>
            <p>“Stay where you are, coward! are you afraid of dead<lb/>  
men standing against walls? Stay where you are. Ah!<lb/>  
here is the chisel—now let us see what you can do with<lb/>  
it.”</p>
            <p>“I am certain I heard another groan, Captain Spike. I<lb/>  
cannot work, sir. I'm of no use here—<hi rend="italics">do</hi> let me come<lb/>  
out, sir, and send a hand down that can swim.”</p>
            <p>Spike uttered a terrible malediction on the miserable<lb/>  
carpenter, one we do not care to repeat; then he cast the<lb/>  
light of the lantern full in the man's face. The quivering<lb/>  
flesh, the pallid face, and the whole countenance wrought<lb/>  
up almost to a frenzy of terror, astonished, as well as <lb/>alarmed him.</p>
            <p>“What ails you, man?” said the captain in a voice of<lb/>  
thunder. “Clap in the chisel, or I'll hurl you off into the<lb/>  
water. There is nothing here, dead or alive, to harm ye!”</p>
            <p>“The groan, sir—I hear it again! <hi rend="italics">Do</hi> let me come out,<lb/>  
Captain Spike.”</p>
            <p>Spike himself, this time, heard what even <hi rend="italics">he</hi> took for a<lb/>  
groan. It came from the depths of the vessel, apparently,<lb/>  
and was sufficiently distinct and audible. Astonished, yet<lb/>  
appalled, he thrust his shoulders into the aperture, as if to<lb/>  
dare the demon that tormented him, and was met by the<lb/>  
carpenter endeavouring to escape. In the struggle that<lb/>  
ensued, the lantern was dropped into the water, leaving the<lb/>  
half-frenzied combatants contending in the dark. The<lb/>
               <pb n="155"/>  
groan was renewed, when the truth flashed on the minds<lb/>  
of both.</p>
            <p>“The shores! the shores!” exclaimed the carpenter<lb/>  
from within. “The shores!” repeated Spike, throwing<lb/>  
himself back into the boat, and shouting to his men to<lb/>  
“see all clear of the wreck!” The grating of one of the<lb/>  
shores on the coral beneath was now heard plainer than<lb/>  
ever, and the lower extremity slipped outward, not astern,<lb/>  
as had been apprehended, letting the wreck slowly settle to<lb/>  
the bottom again. One piercing shriek arose from the<lb/>  
narrow cavity within; then the gurgling of water into the<lb/>  
aperture was heard, when naught of sound could be <lb/>distinguished but the sullen and steady wash of the waves of the<lb/>  
gulf over the rocks of the reef.</p>
            <p>The impression made by this accident was most <lb/>profound. A fatality appeared to attend the brig; and most<lb/>  
of the men connected the sad occurrence of this night with<lb/>  
the strange appearance of the previous evening. Even the<lb/>  
Señor Montefalderon was disposed to abandon the <lb/>doubloons, and he urged Spike to make the best of his way for<lb/>  
Yucatan, to seek a friendly harbour. The captain <lb/>wavered, but avarice was too strong a passion in him to be <lb/>easily diverted from its object, and he refused to give up his<lb/>  
purpose.</p>
            <p>As the wreck was entirely free from the brig when it<lb/>  
went down for the third time, no injury was sustained by<lb/>  
the last on this occasion. By renewing the lashings, <lb/>everything would be ready to begin the work anew—and this,<lb/>  
Spike was resolved to attempt in the morning. The men<lb/>  
were too much fatigued, and it was too dark to think of<lb/>  
pushing matters any further that night; and it was very<lb/>  
questionable whether they could have been got to work.<lb/>  
Orders were consequently given for all hands to turn in,<lb/>  
the captain, relieved by Don Juan and Jack Tier, having<lb/>  
arranged to keep the watches of the night.</p>
            <p>“This is a sad accident, Don Esteban,” observed the<lb/>  
Mexican, as he and Spike paced the quarter-deck together,<lb/>  
just before the last turned in; “a sad accident! My <lb/>miserable schooner seems to be deserted by its patron saint.<lb/>  
Then your poor carpenter!”</p>
            <p>“Yes, he was a good fellow enough with a saw, or an<lb/>
               <pb n="156"/>  
adze,” answered Spike, yawning. “But we get used to<lb/>  
such things at sea. It's neither more nor less than a <lb/>carpenter expended. Good night, Señor Don Wan; in the<lb/>  
morning we'll be at that gold ag'in.”</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Spike</hi> was sleeping hard in his berth, quite early on the<lb/>  
following morning, before the return of light, indeed, when<lb/>  
he suddenly started up, rubbed his eyes, and sprang upon<lb/>  
deck like a man alarmed. He had heard, or fancied he<lb/>  
had heard, a cry. A voice once well known and listened<lb/>  
to, seemed to call him in the very portals of his ear. At<lb/>  
first he had listened to its words in wonder, entranced like<lb/>  
the bird by the snake, the tones recalling scenes and <lb/>persons that had once possessed a strong control over his rude<lb/>  
feelings. Presently the voice became harsher in its <lb/>utterance, and it said.</p>
            <p>“Stephen Spike, awake! The hour is getting late, and<lb/>  
you have enemies nearer to you than you imagine. Awake,<lb/>  
Stephen, awake!”</p>
            <p>When the captain was on his feet, and had plunged his<lb/>  
head into a basin of water that stood ready for him in the<lb/>  
state-room, he could not have told, for his life, whether he<lb/>  
had been dreaming or waking, whether what he had heard<lb/>  
was the result of a feverish imagination, or of the laws of<lb/>  
nature. The call haunted him all that morning, or until<lb/>  
events of importance so pressed upon him as to draw his<lb/>  
undivided attention to them alone.</p>
            <p>It was not yet day. The men were still in heavy sleep,<lb/>  
lying about the decks, for they avoided the small and<lb/>
               <pb n="157"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
crowded forecastle in that warm climate, and the night was<lb/>  
apparently at its deepest hour. Spike walked forward to<lb/>  
look for the man charged with the anchor-watch. It proved<lb/>  
to be Jack Tier, who was standing near the galley, his<lb/>  
arms folded as usual, apparently watching the few signs of<lb/>  
approaching day that were beginning to be apparent in the<lb/>  
western sky. The captain was in none of the best humours<lb/>  
with the steward's assistant; but Jack had unaccountably<lb/>  
got an ascendency over his commander, which it was <lb/>certainly very unusual for any subordinate in the Swash to<lb/>  
obtain. Spike had deferred more to Mulford than to any<lb/>  
mate he had ever before employed; but this was the <lb/>deference due to superior information, manners, and origin. It<lb/>  
was common-place, if not vulgar; whereas, the ascendency<lb/>  
obtained by little Jack Tier was, even to its subject, <lb/>entirely inexplicable. He was unwilling to admit it to <lb/>himself in the most secret manner, though he had begun to<lb/>  
feel it on all occasions which brought them in contact, and<lb/>  
to submit to it as a thing not to be averted.</p>
            <p>“Jack Tier,” demanded the captain, now that he found<lb/>  
himself once more alone with the other, desirous of <lb/>obtaining his opinion on a point that harassed him, though he<lb/>  
knew not why; “Jack Tier, answer me one thing. Do<lb/>  
you believe that we saw the form of a dead or of a living<lb/>  
man at the foot of the light-house?”</p>
            <p>“The dead are never seen leaning against walls in that<lb/>  
manner, Stephen Spike,” answered Jack, coolly, not even<lb/>  
taking the trouble to uncoil his arms. “What you saw<lb/>  
was a living man; and you would do well to be on your<lb/>  
guard against him. Harry Mulford is not your friend—<lb/>  
and there is reason for it.”</p>
            <p>“Harry Mulford, and living! How can that be, Jack?<lb/>  
You know the port in which he chose to run.”</p>
            <p>“I know the rock on which you chose to abandon him,<lb/>  
Captain Spike.”</p>
            <p>“If so, how could he be living and at the Dry Tortugas.<lb/>  
The thing is impossible!”</p>
            <p>“The thing is so. You saw Harry Mulford, living and<lb/>  
well, and ready to hunt you to the gallows. Beware of<lb/>  
him, then; and beware of his handsome wife!”</p>
            <pb n="158"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“Wife! the fellow has no wife—he has always professed<lb/>  
to be a single man!”</p>
            <p>“The man is married—and I bid you beware of his<lb/>  
handsome wife. She, too, will be a witness ag'in you.”</p>
            <p>“This will be news, then, for Rose Budd. I shall <lb/>delight in telling it to <hi rend="italics">her,</hi> at least.”</p>
            <p>“'T will be <hi rend="italics">no</hi> news to Rose Budd. She was present at<lb/>  
the wedding, and will not be taken by surprise. Rose loves<lb/>  
Harry too well to let him marry, and she not present at the<lb/>  
wedding.”</p>
            <p>“Jack, you talk strangely! What is the meaning of all<lb/>  
this? I am captain of this craft, and will not be trifled<lb/>  
with—tell me at once your meaning, fellow.”</p>
            <p>“My meaning is simple enough, and easily told. Rose<lb/>  
Budd is the wife of Harry Mulford.”</p>
            <p>“You're dreaming, fellow, or are wishing to trifle with<lb/>  
me!”</p>
            <p>“It may be a dream, but it is one that will turn out to<lb/>  
be true. If they have found the Poughkeepsie <lb/>sloop-of-war, as I make no doubt they have by this time, Mulford<lb/>  
and Rose are man and wife.”</p>
            <p>“Fool! you know not what you say! Rose is at this<lb/>  
moment in her berth, sick at heart on account of the young<lb/>  
gentleman who preferred to live on the Florida Reef rather<lb/>  
than to sail in the Molly!”</p>
            <p>“Rose is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> in her berth, sick or well; neither is she on<lb/>  
board this brig at all. She went off in the light-house boat<lb/>  
to deliver her lover from the naked rock—and well did she<lb/>  
succeed in so doing. God was of her side, Stephen Spike;<lb/>  
and a body seldom fails with such a friend to support one.”</p>
            <p>Spike was astounded at these words, and not less so at<lb/>  
the cool and confident manner with which they were <lb/>pronounced. Jack spoke in a certain dogmatical, oracular<lb/>  
manner, it is true, one that might have lessened his <lb/>authority with a person over whom he had less influence; but<lb/>  
this in no degree diminished its effect on Spike. On the<lb/>  
contrary, it even disposed the captain to yield an implicit<lb/>  
faith to what he heard, and all so much the more because<lb/>  
the facts he was told appeared of themselves to be nearly<lb/>  
impossible. It was half a minute before he had sufficiently<lb/>  
recovered from his surprise to continue the discourse.</p>
            <pb n="159"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“The light-house boat!” Spike then slowly repeated.<lb/>  
“Why, fellow, you told me the light-house boat went adrift<lb/>  
from your own hands!”</p>
            <p>“So it did,” answered Jack, coolly, “since I cast off the<lb/>  
painter—and what is more, went in it.”</p>
            <p>“You! This is impossible. You are telling me a <lb/>fabricated lie. If you had gone away in that boat, how could<lb/>  
you now be here? No, no—it is a miserable lie, and Rose<lb/>  
is below!”</p>
            <p>“Go and look into her state-room, and satisfy yourself<lb/>  
with your own eyes.”</p>
            <p>Spike did as was suggested. He went below, took a<lb/>  
lamp that was always suspended, lighted in the main cabin,<lb/>  
and, without ceremony, proceeded to Rose's state-room,<lb/>  
where he soon found that the bird had really flown. A<lb/>  
direful execration followed this discovery, one so loud as<lb/>  
to awaken Mrs. Budd and Biddy. Determined not to do<lb/>  
things by halves, he broke open the door of the widow's<lb/>  
state-room, and ascertained that the person he sought was<lb/>  
not there. A fierce explosion of oaths and denunciations<lb/>  
followed, which produced an answer in the customary<lb/>  
screams. In the midst of this violent scene, however,<lb/>  
questions were put, and answers obtained, that not only<lb/>  
served to let the captain know that Jack had told him <lb/>nothing but truth, but to put an end to everything like <lb/>amicable relations between himself and the relict of his old<lb/>  
commander. Until this explosion, appearances had been<lb/>  
observed between them; but, from that moment, there must<lb/>  
necessarily be an end of all professions of even civility.<lb/>  
Spike was never particularly refined in his intercourse with<lb/>  
females, but he now threw aside even its pretension. His<lb/>  
rage was so great that he totally forgot his manhood, and<lb/>  
lavished on both Mrs. Budd and Biddy epithets that were<lb/>  
altogether inexcusable, and many of which it will not do<lb/>  
to repeat. Weak and silly as was the widow, she was not<lb/>  
without spirit; and on this occasion she was indisposed to<lb/>  
submit to all this unmerited abuse in silence. Biddy, as<lb/>  
usual, took her cue from her mistress, and between the two,<lb/>  
their part of the wordy conflict was kept up with a very<lb/>  
respectable degree of animation.</p>
            <p>“I know you—I know you, now!” screamed the widow,<lb/>
               <pb n="160"/>  
at the tope of her voice; “and you can no longer deceive<lb/>  
me, unworthy son of Neptune as you are! You are unfit<lb/>  
to be a lubber, and would be log-booked for an or'nary by<lb/>  
every gentleman on board ship. You, a full-jiggered <lb/>seaman! No, you are not even half-jiggered, sir; and I tell<lb/>  
you so to your face.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, and it is n't <hi rend="italics">half</hi> that might be tould the likes of<lb/>  
yees!” put in Biddy, as her mistress stopped to breathe.<lb/>  
“And it's Miss Rose you'd have for a wife, when Biddy<lb/>  
Noon would be too good for ye! We knows ye, and all<lb/>  
about ye, and can give yer history as complate from the<lb/>  
day ye was born down to the prisent moment; and not find<lb/>  
a good word to say in yer favour in all that time — and a<lb/>  
precious time it is, too, for a gentleman that would marry<lb/>  
pretthy, <hi rend="italics">young</hi> Miss Rose! Och! I scorn to look at ye,<lb/>  
yer so ugly!”</p>
            <p>“And trying to persuade me you were a friend of my<lb/>  
poor, dear Mr. Budd, whose shoe you are unworthy to<lb/>  
touch, and who had the heart and soul for the noble <lb/>profession you disgrace,” cut in the widow, the moment Biddy<lb/>  
gave her a chance, by pausing to make a wry face as she<lb/>  
pronounced the word “ugly.” “I now believe you <lb/>capasided them poor Mexicans, in order to get their money;<lb/>  
and the moment we cast anchor in a road-side, I'll go ashore,<lb/>  
and complain of you for murder, I will.”</p>
            <p>“Do, missus, dear, and I'll be your bail, will I, and<lb/>  
swear to all that happened, and more too. Och! yer a<lb/>  
wretch, to wish to be the husband of Miss Rose, and she<lb/>  
so young and pretthy, and you so ould and ugly!”</p>
            <p>“Come away—come away, Stephen Spike, and do not<lb/>  
stand wrangling with women, when you and your brig, and<lb/>  
all that belongs to you, are in danger,” called out Jack Tier<lb/>  
from the companion-way. “Day is come; and what is<lb/>  
much worse for you, your most dangerous enemy is coming<lb/>  
with it.”</p>
            <p>Spike was almost livid with rage, and ready to burst out<lb/>  
in awful maledictions; but at this summons he sprang to<lb/>  
the ladder, and was on deck in a moment. At first, he felt<lb/>  
a strong disposition to wreak his vengeance on Tier, but,<lb/>  
fortunately for the latter, as the captain's foot touched the<lb/>  
quarter-deck, his eye fell on the Poughkeepsie, then within<lb/>
               <pb n="161"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
half a league of the Swash, standing in toward the reef,<lb/>  
though fully half a mile to leeward. This spectre drove<lb/>  
all other subjects from his mind, leaving the captain of the<lb/>  
Swash in the only character in which he could be said to<lb/>  
be respectable, or that of a seaman. Almost instinctively<lb/>  
he called all hands, then he gave one brief minute to a <lb/>survey of his situation.</p>
            <p>It was, indeed, time for the Swash to be moving. There<lb/>  
she lay, with three anchors down, including that of the<lb/>  
schooner, all she had, in fact, with the exception of her<lb/>  
best bower, and one kedge, with the purchases aloft, in<lb/>  
readiness for hooking on to the wreck, and all the extra <lb/>securities up that had been given to the masts. As for the<lb/>  
sloop-of-war, she was under the very same canvas as that<lb/>  
with which she had come out from the Dry Tortugas, or<lb/>  
her three top-sails, spanker, and jib; but most of her other<lb/>  
sails were loose, even to her royals and flying-jibs; though<lb/>  
closely gathered into their spars by means of the running<lb/>  
gear. In a word, every sailor would know, at a glance,<lb/>  
that the ship was merely waiting for the proper moment to<lb/>  
spread her wings, when she would be flying through the<lb/>  
water at the top of her speed. The weather looked dirty,<lb/>  
and the wind was gradually increasing, threatening to blow<lb/>  
heavily as the day advanced.</p>
            <p>“Unshackle, unshackle!” shouted Spike to the <lb/>boatswain, who was the first man that appeared on deck. “The<lb/>  
bloody sloop-of-war is upon us, and there is not a moment<lb/>  
to lose. We must get the brig clear of the ground in the<lb/>  
shortest way we can, and abandon everything. Unshackle,<lb/>  
and cast off for'ard and aft, men.”</p>
            <p>A few minutes of almost desperate exertion succeeded.<lb/>  
No men work like sailors, when the last are in a hurry,<lb/>  
their efforts being directed to counteracting squalls, and<lb/>  
avoiding emergencies of the most pressing character.<lb/>  
Thus was it now with the crew of the Swash. The <lb/>clanking of chains lasted but a minute, when the parts attached<lb/>  
to the anchors were thrust through the hawse-holes, or were<lb/>  
dropped into the water from other parts of the brig. This<lb/>  
at once released the vessel, though a great deal remained<lb/>  
to be done to clear her for working, and to put her in the<lb/>  
best trim.</p>
            <pb n="162"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“Away with this out-hauler!” again shouted Spike, <lb/>casting loose the main-brails as he did so; “loose the jibs!”</p>
            <p>All went on at once, and the Swash moved away from<lb/>  
the grave of the poor carpenter with the ease and facility<lb/>  
of motion that marked all her evolutions. Then the <lb/>topsail was let fall, and presently all the upper square-sails<lb/>  
were sheeted home, and hoisted, and the fore-tack was<lb/>  
hauled aboard. The Molly was soon alive, and jumping<lb/>  
into the seas that met her with more power than was <lb/>common, as she drew out from under the shelter of the reef<lb/>  
into rough water. From the time when Spike gave his<lb/>  
first order, to that when all his canvas was spread, was just<lb/>  
seven minutes.</p>
            <p>The Poughkeepsie, with her vastly superior crew, was<lb/>  
not idle the while. Although the watch below was not <lb/>disturbed, she tacked beautifully, and stood off the reef, in a<lb/>  
line parallel to the course of the brig, and distant from her<lb/>  
about half a mile. Then sail was made, her tacks having<lb/>  
been boarded in stays. Spike knew the play of his craft<lb/>  
was short legs, for she was so nimble in her movements that<lb/>  
he believed she could go about in half the time that would<lb/>  
be required for a vessel of the Poughkeepsie's length.<lb/>  
“Ready about,” was his cry, therefore, when less than a<lb/>  
mile distant from the reef—“ready about, and let her go<lb/>  
round.” Round the Molly did go, like a top, being full on<lb/>  
the other tack in just fifty-six seconds. The movement of<lb/>  
the corvette was more stately, and somewhat more <lb/>deliberate. Still, she stayed beautifully, and both Spike and<lb/>  
the boatswain shook their heads, as they saw her coming<lb/>  
into the wind with her sails all lifting and the sheets<lb/>  
flowing.</p>
            <p>“That fellow will fore-reach a cable's length before he<lb/>  
gets about!” exclaimed Spike. “He will prove too much<lb/>  
for us at this sport! Keep her away, my man—keep the<lb/>  
brig away for the passage. We must run through the reef,<lb/>  
instead of trusting ourselves to our heels in open water.”</p>
            <p>The brig was kept away accordingly, and sheets were<lb/>  
eased off, and braces just touched, to meet the new line of<lb/>  
sailing. As the wind stood, it was possible to lay through<lb/>  
the passage on an easy bowline, though the breeze, which<lb/>  
was getting to be fresher than Spike wished it to be, <lb/>
               <pb n="163"/>promised to haul more to the southward of east, as the day<lb/>  
advanced. Nevertheless, this was the Swash's best point<lb/>  
of sailing, and all on board of her had strong hopes of her<lb/>  
being too much for her pursuer, could she maintain it.<lb/>  
Until this feeling began to diffuse itself in the brig, not a<lb/>  
countenance was to be seen on her decks that did not <lb/>betray intense anxiety; but now something like grim smiles<lb/>  
passed among the crew, as their craft seemed rather to fly<lb/>  
than force her way through the water, toward the entrance<lb/>  
of the passage so often adverted to in this narrative.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Poughkeepsie was admirably<lb/>  
sailed and handled. Everybody was now on deck, and the<lb/>  
first lieutenant had taken the trumpet. Captain Mull was<lb/>  
a man of method, and a thorough man-of-war's man. <lb/>Whatever he did was done according to rule, and with great<lb/>  
system. Just as the Swash was about to enter the passage,<lb/>  
the drum of the Poughkeepsie beat to quarters. No sooner<lb/>  
were the men mustered, in the leeward, or the starboard<lb/>  
batteries, than orders were sent to cast loose the guns, and<lb/>  
to get them ready for service. Owing to the more leeward<lb/>  
position of his vessel, and to the fact that she always <lb/>head-reached so much in stays, Captain Mull knew that she<lb/>  
would not lose much by luffing into the wind, or by making<lb/>  
half-boards, while he might gain everything by one <lb/>well-directed shot.</p>
            <p>The strife commenced by the sloop-of-war, firing her<lb/>  
weather bow-gun, single-shotted, at the Swash. No damage<lb/>  
was done, though the fore-yard of the brig had a very <lb/>narrow escape. This experiment was repeated three times,<lb/>  
without even a rope-yarn being carried away, though the<lb/>  
gun was pointed by Wallace himself, and well pointed, too.<lb/>  
But it is possible for a shot to come very near its object<lb/>  
and still to do no injury. Such was the fact on this <lb/>occasion, though the “ship's gentleman” was a good deal <lb/>mortified by the result. Men look so much at success as the<lb/>  
test of merit, that few pause to inquire into the reasons of<lb/>  
failures, though it frequently happens that adventures <lb/>prosper by means of their very blunders. Captain Mull now<lb/>  
determined on a half-board, for his ship was more to <lb/>leeward than he desired. Directions were given to the officers<lb/>  
in the batteries to be deliberate, and the helm was put<lb/>
               <pb n="164"/>  
down. As the ship shot into the wind, each gun was fired,<lb/>  
as it could be brought to bear, until the last of them all<lb/>  
was discharged. Then the course of the vessel was<lb/>  
changed, the helm being righted before the ship had lost<lb/>  
her way, and the sloop-of-war fell off again to her course.</p>
            <p>All this was done in such a short period of time as<lb/>  
scarcely to cause the Poughkeepsie to lose anything, while<lb/>  
it did the Swash the most serious injury. The guns had<lb/>  
been directed at the brig's spars and sails, Captain Mull<lb/>  
desiring no more than to capture his chase, and the <lb/>destruction they produced aloft was such as to induce Spike<lb/>  
and his men, at first, to imagine that the whole hamper<lb/>  
above their heads was about to come clattering down on<lb/>  
deck. One shot carried away all the weather <lb/>fore-topmast rigging of the brig, and would no doubt have brought<lb/>  
about the loss of the mast, if another, that almost instantly<lb/>  
succeeded it, had not cut the spar itself in two, bringing<lb/>  
down, as a matter of course, everything above it. Nearly<lb/>  
half of the main-mast was gouged out of that spar, and the<lb/>  
gaff was taken fairly out of its jaws. The fore-yard was<lb/>  
cut in the slings, and various important ropes were carried<lb/>  
away in different parts of the vessel.</p>
            <p>Flight, under such circumstances, was impossible, <lb/>unless some extraordinary external assistance was to be <lb/>obtained. This Spike saw at once, and he had recourse to<lb/>  
the only expedient that remained; which might possibly<lb/>  
yet save him. The guns were still belching forth their<lb/>  
smoke and flames, when he shouted out the order to put<lb/>  
the helm hard up. The width of the passage in which the<lb/>  
vessels were was not so great but that he might hope to<lb/>  
pass across it, and to enter a channel among the rocks,<lb/>  
which was favourably placed for such a purpose, ere the<lb/>  
sloop-of-war could overtake him. Whither that channel<lb/>  
led, what water it possessed, or whether it were not a <lb/>shallow<hi rend="italics">cul de sac,</hi> were all facts of which Spike was ignorant.<lb/>  
The circumstances, however, would not admit of an <lb/>alternative.</p>
            <p>Happily for the execution of Spike's present design,<lb/>  
nothing from aloft had fallen into the water, to impede the<lb/>  
brig's way. Forward, in particular, she seemed all wreck;<lb/>  
her fore-yard having come down altogether, so as to enried<lb/>
               <pb n="165"/>enried the forecastle, while her top-mast, with its <lb/>dependent spars and gear, was suspended but a short distance<lb/>  
above. Still, nothing had gone over the side, so as actually<lb/>  
to touch the water, and the craft obeyed her helm as usual.<lb/>  
Away she went, then, for the lateral opening in the reef<lb/>  
just mentioned, driven ahead by the pressure of a strong<lb/>  
breeze on her sails, which still offered large surfaces to the<lb/>  
wind, at a rapid rate. Instead of keeping away to follow,<lb/>  
the Poughkeepsie maintained her luff, and just as the Swash<lb/>  
entered the unknown passage, into which she was blindly<lb/>  
plunging, the sloop-of-war was about a quarter of a mile to<lb/>  
windward, and standing directly across her stern. Nothing<lb/>  
would have been easier, now, than for Captain Mull to<lb/>  
destroy his chase; but humanity prevented his firing. He<lb/>  
knew that her career must be short, and he fully expected<lb/>  
to see her anchor; when it would be easy for him to take<lb/>  
possession with his boats. With this expectation, indeed,<lb/>  
he shortened sail, furling top-gallant-sails, and hauling up<lb/>  
his courage. By this time, the wind had so much <lb/>freshened, as to induce him to think of putting in a reef, and<lb/>  
the step now taken had a double object in view.</p>
            <p>To the surprise of all on board the man-of-war, the brig<lb/>  
continued on, until she was fully a mile distant, finding<lb/>  
her way deeper and deeper among the mazes of the reef<lb/>  
without meeting with any impediment! This fact induced<lb/>  
Captain Mull to order his Paixhans to throw their shells<lb/>  
beyond her, by way of a hint to anchor. While the guns<lb/>  
were getting ready, Spike stood on boldly, knowing it was<lb/>  
neck or nothing, and beginning to feel a faint revival of<lb/>  
hope, as he found himself getting further and further from<lb/>  
his pursuers, and the rocks not fetching him up. Even the<lb/>  
men, who had begun to murmur at what seemed to them<lb/>  
to be risking too much, partook, in a slight degree, of the<lb/>  
same feeling, and began to execute the order they had <lb/>received to try to get the launch into the water, with some<lb/>  
appearance of an intention to succeed. Previously, the<lb/>  
work could scarcely be said to go on at all; but two or<lb/>  
three of the older seamen now bestirred themselves, and<lb/>  
suggestions were made and attended to, that promised <lb/>results But it was no easy thing to get the launch out of a<lb/>  
half-rigged brig, that had lost her fore-yard, and which <lb/>
               <pb n="166"/>carried nothing square abaft. A derrick was used in <lb/>common, to lift the stern of the boat, but a derrick would now<lb/>  
be useless aft, without an assistant forward. While these<lb/>  
things were in discussion, under the superintendence of<lb/>  
the boatswain, and Spike was standing between the <lb/>knight-heads, conning the craft, the sloop-of-war let fly the first of<lb/>  
her hollow shot. Down came the hurtling mass upon the<lb/>  
Swash, keeping every head elevated and all eyes looking<lb/>  
for the dark object, as it went booming through the air<lb/>  
above their heads. The shot passed fully a mile to <lb/>leeward, where it exploded. This great range had been given<lb/>  
to the first shot, with a view to admonish the captain how<lb/>  
long he must continue under the guns of the ship, and as<lb/>  
advice to come to. The second gun followed immediately.<lb/>  
Its shot was seem to ricochet, directly in a line with the<lb/>  
brig, making leaps of about half a mile in length. It struck<lb/>  
the water about fifty yards astern of the vessel, bounded<lb/>  
directly over her decks, passing through the main-sail and<lb/>  
some of the fallen hamper forward, and exploded about a<lb/>  
hundred yards ahead. As usually happens with such <lb/>projectiles, most of the fragments were either scattered <lb/>laterally, or went on, impelled by the original momentum.</p>
            <p>The effect of this last gun on the crew of the Swash<lb/>  
was instantaneous and deep. The faint gleamings of hope<lb/>  
vanished at once, and a lively consciousness of the <lb/>desperate nature of their condition succeeded in every mind.<lb/>  
The launch was forgotten, and, after conferring together<lb/>  
for a moment, the men went in a body, with the boatswain<lb/>  
at their head, to the forecastle, and offered a remonstrance<lb/>  
to their commander, on the subject of holding out any<lb/>  
longer, under circumstances so very hazardous, and which<lb/>  
menaced their lives in so many different ways. Spike <lb/>listened to them with eyes that fairly glared with fury. He<lb/>  
ordered them back to their duty in a voice of thunder, <lb/>tapping the breast of his jacket, where he was known to carry<lb/>  
revolvers, with a significance that could convey but one<lb/>  
meaning.</p>
            <p>It is wonderful the ascendency that men sometimes <lb/>obtain over their fellows, by means of character, the habits<lb/>  
of command, and obedience, and intimidation. Spike was<lb/>  
a stern disciplinarian, relying on that and ample pay for<lb/>
               <pb n="167"/>  
the unlimited control he often found it necessary to <lb/>exercise over his crew. On the present occasion, his people<lb/>  
were profoundly alarmed, but habitual deference and <lb/>submission to their leader counteracted the feeling, and held<lb/>  
them in suspense. They were fully aware of the nature<lb/>  
of the position they occupied in a legal sense, and were<lb/>  
deeply reluctant to increase the appearances of crime; but<lb/>  
most of them had been extricated from so many grave <lb/>difficulties in former instances, by the coolness, nerve and<lb/>  
readiness of the captain, that a latent ray of hope was <lb/>perhaps dimly shining in the rude breast of every old sea-dog<lb/>  
among them. As a consequence of these several causes,<lb/>  
they abandoned their remonstrance, for the moment at<lb/>  
least, and made a show of returning to their duty; though<lb/>  
it was in a sullen and moody manner.</p>
            <p>It was easier, however, to make a show of hoisting out<lb/>  
the launch, than to effect the object. This was soon made<lb/>  
apparent on trial, and Spike himself gave the matter up.<lb/>  
He ordered the yawl to be lowered, got alongside, and to<lb/>  
be prepared for the reception of the crew, by putting into<lb/>  
it a small provision of food and water. All this time the<lb/>  
brig was rushing madly to leeward, among rocks and <lb/>breakers, without any other guide than that which the visible<lb/>  
dangers afforded. Spike knew no more where he was<lb/>  
going than the meanest man in his vessel. His sole aim<lb/>  
was to get away from his pursuers, and to save his neck<lb/>  
from the rope. He magnified the danger of punishment<lb/>  
that he really ran, for he best knew the extent and nature<lb/>  
of his crimes, of which the few that have been laid before<lb/>  
the reader, while they might have been amongst the most<lb/>  
prominent, as viewed through the statutes and international<lb/>  
law, were far from the gravest he had committed in the eyes<lb/>  
of morals.</p>
            <p>About this time the Señor Montefalderon went forward<lb/>  
to confer with Spike. The calmness of this gentleman's<lb/>  
demeanour, the simplicity and coolness of his movements,<lb/>  
denoted a conscience that saw no particular ground for<lb/>  
alarm. He wished to escape captivity, that he might <lb/>continue to serve his country, but no other apprehension <lb/>troubled him.</p>
            <p>“Do you intend to trust yourself in the yawl, Don <lb/>
               <pb n="168"/>Esteban?” demanded the Mexican quietly. “If so, is she not<lb/>  
too small to contain so many as we shall make altogether?”</p>
            <p>Spike's answer was given in a low voice; and it <lb/>evidently came from a very husky throat.</p>
            <p>“Speak lower, Don Wan,” he said. “The boat would<lb/>  
be greatly overloaded with all hands in it, especially among<lb/>  
the breakers, and blowing as it does; but we may leave<lb/>  
some of the party behind.”</p>
            <p>“The brig <hi rend="italics">must</hi> go on the rocks, sooner or later, Don<lb/>  
Esteban; when she does, she will go to pieces in an hour.</p>
            <p>“I expect to hear her strike every minute, señor; the<lb/>  
moment she does, we must be off. I have had my eye on<lb/>  
that ship for some time, expecting to see her lower her <lb/>cutters and gigs to board us. <hi rend="italics">You</hi> will not be out of the way,<lb/>  
Don Wan; but there is no need of being talkative on the<lb/>  
subject of our escape.”</p>
            <p>Spike now turned his back on the Mexican, looking <lb/>anxiously ahead, with the desire to get as far into the reef as<lb/>  
possible with his brig, which he conned with great skill<lb/>  
and coolness. The Señor Montefalderon left him. With<lb/>  
the chivalry and consideration of a man and a gentleman,<lb/>  
he went in quest of Mrs. Budd and Biddy. A hint sufficed<lb/>  
for them, and gathering together a few necessaries they<lb/>  
were in the yawl in the next three minutes. This <lb/>movement was unseen by Spike, or he might have prevented it.<lb/>  
His eyes were now riveted on the channel ahead. It had<lb/>  
been fully his original intention to make off in the boat, the<lb/>  
instant the brig struck, abandoning not only Don Juan,<lb/>  
with Mrs. Budd and Biddy to their fates, but most of the<lb/>  
crew. A private order had been given to the boatswain,<lb/>  
and three of the ablest-bodied among the seamen, each and<lb/>  
all of whom kept the secret with religious fidelity, as it<lb/>  
was believed their own personal safety might be connected<lb/>  
with the success of this plan.</p>
            <p>Nothing is so contagious as alarm. It requires not only<lb/>  
great natural steadiness of nerve, but much acquired <lb/>firmness to remain unmoved when sudden terror has seized on<lb/>  
the minds of those around us. Habitual respect had <lb/>prevented the crew from interfering with the movements of<lb/>  
the Mexican, who not only descended into the boat with<lb/>  
his female companions uninterrupted, but also took with<lb/>
               <pb n="169"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
him the little bag of doubloons which fell to his share from<lb/>  
the first raising of the schooner. Josh and Jack Tier<lb/>  
assisted in getting Mrs. Budd and Biddy over the side, and<lb/>  
both took their own places in the yawl, as soon as this<lb/>  
pious duty was discharged. This served as a hint to others<lb/>  
near at hand; and man after man left his work to steal<lb/>  
into the yawl, until every living being had disappeared<lb/>  
from the deck of the Swash, Spike himself excepted. The<lb/>  
man at the wheel had been the last to desert his post, nor<lb/>  
would he have done so then, but for a signal from the <lb/>boatswain, with whom he was a favourite.</p>
            <p>It is certain there was a secret desire among the people<lb/>  
of the Swash, who were now crowded into a boat not large<lb/>  
enough to contain more than half their number with safety,<lb/>  
to push off from the brig's side, and abandon her <lb/>commander and owner to his fate. All had passed so soon,<lb/>  
however, and events succeeded each other with so much<lb/>  
rapidity, that little time was given for consultation. Habit<lb/>  
kept them in their places, though the appearances around<lb/>  
them were strong motives for taking care of themselves.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the time necessary to relate the <lb/>foregoing events, a quarter of an hour had not elapsed, from<lb/>  
the moment when the Swash entered this unknown <lb/>channel among the rocks, ere she struck. No sooner was her<lb/>  
helm deserted than she broached-to, and Spike was in the<lb/>  
act of denouncing the steerage, ignorant of its cause, when<lb/>  
the brig was thrown, broadside-to, on a sharp, angular bed<lb/>  
of rocks. It was fortunate for the boat, and all in it, that<lb/>  
it was brought to leeward by the broaching-to of the <lb/>vessel, and that the water was still sufficiently deep around<lb/>  
them to prevent the waves from breaking. Breakers there<lb/>  
were, however, in thousands, on every side; and the <lb/>seamen understood that their situation was almost <lb/>desperately perilous, without shipwreck coming to increase the<lb/>  
danger.</p>
            <p>The storm itself was scarcely more noisy and boisterous<lb/>  
than was Spike, when he ascertained the manner in which<lb/>  
his people had behaved. At first, he believed it was their<lb/>  
plan to abandon him to his fate; but, on rushing to the<lb/>  
lee-gangway, Don Juan Montefalderon assured him that no<lb/>  
such intention existed, and that he would not allow the<lb/>
               <pb n="170"/>  
boat to be cast off until the captain was received on board.<lb/>  
This brief respite gave Spike a moment to care for his <lb/>portion of the doubloons; and he rushed to his state-room to<lb/>  
secure them, together with his quadrant.</p>
            <p>The grinding of the brig's bottom on the coral, <lb/>announced a speedy breaking up of the craft, while her <lb/>commander was thus employed. So violent were some of the<lb/>  
shocks with which she came down on the hard bed in<lb/>  
which she was now cradled, that Spike expected to see her<lb/>  
burst asunder, while he was yet on her decks. The <lb/>cracking of timbers told him that all was over with the Swash,<lb/>  
nor had he got back as far as the gangway with his prize,<lb/>  
before he saw plainly that the vessel had broken her back,<lb/>  
as it is termed, and that her plank-sheer was opening in a<lb/>  
way that threatened to permit a separation of the craft into<lb/>  
two sections, one forward and the other aft. <lb/>Notwithstanding all these portentous proofs that the minutes of the<lb/>  
Molly were numbered, and the danger that existed of his<lb/>  
being abandoned by his crew, Spike paused a moment, ere<lb/>  
he went over the vessel's side, to take a hasty survey of the<lb/>  
reef. His object was to get a general idea of the position<lb/>  
of the breakers, with a view to avoid them. As much of<lb/>  
the interest of that which is to succeed is connected with<lb/>  
these particular dangers, it may be well to explain their <lb/>character, along with a few other points of a similar bearing.</p>
            <p>The brig had gone ashore fully two miles within the <lb/>passage she had entered, and which, indeed, terminated at the<lb/>  
very spot where she had struck. The Poughkeepsie was<lb/>  
standing off and on, in the main channel, with her boats<lb/>  
in the water, evidently preparing to carry the brig in that<lb/>  
mode. As for the breakers, they whitened the surface of<lb/>  
the ocean in all directions around the wreck, far as the eye<lb/>  
could reach, but in two. The passage in which the <lb/>Poughkeepsie was standing to and fro was clear of them, of<lb/>  
course; and about a mile and a half to the northward,<lb/>  
Spike saw that he should be in open water, or altogether<lb/>  
on the northern side of the reef, could he only get there.<lb/>  
The gravest dangers would exist in the passage, which led<lb/>  
among breakers on all sides, and very possibly among rocks<lb/>  
so near the surface as absolutely to obstruct the way. In<lb/>  
one sense, however, the breakers were useful. By <lb/>
               <pb n="171"/>avoiding them as much as possible, and by keeping in the <lb/>unbroken water, the boat would be running in the channels<lb/>  
of the reef, and consequently would be the safer. The<lb/>  
result of the survey, short as it was, and it did not last a<lb/>  
minute, was to give Spike something like a plan; and when<lb/>  
he went over the side, and got into the boat, it was with a<lb/>  
determination to work his way out of the reef to its northern<lb/>  
edge, as soon as possible, and then to skirt it as near as he<lb/>  
could, in his flight toward the Dry Tortugas.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> was high time that Captain Spike should arrive when<lb/>  
his foot touched the bottom of the yawl. The men were<lb/>  
getting impatient and anxious to the last degree, and the<lb/>  
power of Señor Montefalderon to control them was <lb/>lessening each instant. They heard the rending of timber, and<lb/>  
the grinding on the coral, even more distinctly than the<lb/>  
captain himself, and feared that the brig would break up<lb/>  
while they lay alongside of her, and crush them amid the<lb/>  
ruins. Then the spray of the seas that broke over the<lb/>  
weather side of the brig, fell like rain upon them; and<lb/>  
everybody in the boat was already as wet as if exposed to<lb/>  
a violent shower. It was well, therefore, for Spike that he<lb/>  
descended into the boat as he did, for another minute's<lb/>  
delay might have brought about his own destruction.</p>
            <p>Spike felt a chill at his heart when he looked about him<lb/>  
and saw the condition of the yawl. So crowded were the<lb/>
               <pb n="172"/>  
stern-sheets into which he had descended, that it was with<lb/>  
difficulty he found room to place his feet; it being his <lb/>intention to steer, Jack was ordered to get into the eyes of<lb/>  
the boat, in order to give him a seat. The thwarts were<lb/>  
crowded, and three or four of the people had placed <lb/>themselves in the very bottom of the little craft, in order to be<lb/>  
as much as possible out of the way, as well as in readiness<lb/>  
to bail out water. So seriously, indeed, were all the <lb/>seamen impressed with the gravity of this last duty, that nearly<lb/>  
every man had taken with him some vessel fit for such a<lb/>  
purpose. Rowing was entirely out of the question, there<lb/>  
being no space for the movement of the arms. The yawl<lb/>  
was too low in the water, moreover, for such an operation<lb/>  
in so heavy a sea. In all, eighteen persons were squeezed<lb/>  
into a little craft that would have been sufficiently loaded,<lb/>  
for moderate weather at sea, with its four oarsmen and as<lb/>  
many sitters in the stern-sheets, with, perhaps, one in the<lb/>  
eyes to bring her more on an even keel. In other words,<lb/>  
she had twice the weight in her, in living freight, that it<lb/>  
would have been thought prudent to receive in so small a<lb/>  
craft, in an ordinary time, in or out of a port. In addition<lb/>  
to the human beings enumerated, there was a good deal of<lb/>  
baggage, nearly every individual having had the forethought<lb/>  
to provide a few clothes for a change. The food and water<lb/>  
did not amount to much, no more having been provided<lb/>  
than enough for the purposes of the captain, together with<lb/>  
the four men with whom it had been his intention to <lb/>abandon the brig. The effect of all this cargo was to bring the<lb/>  
yawl quite low in the water; and every sea-faring man in<lb/>  
her had the greatest apprehensions about her being able to<lb/>  
float at all when she got out from under the lee of the<lb/>  
Swash, or into the troubled water. Try it she must, <lb/>however, and Spike, in a reluctant and hesitating manner, gave<lb/>  
the final order to “Shove off!”</p>
            <p>The yawl carried a lugg, as is usually the case with boats<lb/>  
at sea, and the first blast of the breeze upon it satisfied<lb/>  
Spike that his present enterprise was one of the most <lb/>dangerous of any in which he had ever been engaged. The<lb/>  
puffs of wind were quite as much as the boat would bear;<lb/>  
but this he did not mind, as he was running off before it,<lb/>  
and there was little danger of the yawl capsizing with such<lb/>
               <pb n="173"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
a weight in her. It was also an advantage to have swift<lb/>  
way on, to prevent the combing waves from shooting into<lb/>  
the boat, though the wind itself scarce outstrips the send<lb/>  
of the sea in a stiff blow. As the yawl cleared the brig<lb/>  
and began to feel the united power of the wind and waves,<lb/>  
the following short dialogue occurred between the <lb/>boatswain and Spike.</p>
            <p>“I dare not keep my eyes off the breakers ahead,” the<lb/>  
captain commenced, “and must trust to you, Strand, to<lb/>  
report what is going on among the man-of-war's men.<lb/>  
What is the ship about?”</p>
            <p>“Reefing her top-sails just now, sir. All three are on<lb/>  
the caps, and the vessel is laying-to, in a manner.”</p>
            <p>“And her boats?”</p>
            <p>“I see none, sir—ay, ay, there they come from <lb/>alongside of her in a little fleet! There are four of them, sir,<lb/>  
and all are coming down before the wind, wing and wing,<lb/>  
carrying their luggs reefed.”</p>
            <p>“Ours ought to be reefed by rights, too, but we dare<lb/>  
not stop to do it; and these infernal combing seas seem<lb/>  
ready to glance aboard us with all the way we can gather.<lb/>  
Stand by to bail, men; we must pass through a strip of<lb/>  
white water—there is no help for it. God send that we go<lb/>  
clear of the rocks!”</p>
            <p>All this was fearfully true. The adventurers were not<lb/>  
yet more than a cable's length from the brig, and they found<lb/>  
themselves so completely environed with the breakers as to<lb/>  
be compelled to go through them. No man in his senses<lb/>  
would ever have come into such a place at all, except in<lb/>  
the most unavoidable circumstances; and it was with a<lb/>  
species of despair that the seamen of the yawl now saw<lb/>  
their little craft go plunging into the foam.</p>
            <p>But Spike neglected no precaution that experience or<lb/>  
skill could suggest. He had chosen his spot with coolness<lb/>  
and judgment. As the boat rose on the seas he looked<lb/>  
eagerly ahead, and by giving it a timely sheer, he hit a sort<lb/>  
of channel, where there was sufficient water to carry them<lb/>  
clear of the rock, and where the breakers were less <lb/>dangerous than in the shoaler places. The passage lasted<lb/>  
about a minute; and so serious was it, that scarce an <lb/>individual breathed until it was effected. No human skill<lb/>
               <pb n="174"/>  
could prevent the water from combing in over the <lb/>gunwales; and when the danger was passed, the yawl was a<lb/>  
third filled with water. There was no time or place to<lb/>  
pause, but on the little craft was dragged almost gunwale<lb/>  
to, the breeze coming against the lugg in puffs that <lb/>threatened to take the mast out of her. All hands were bailing;<lb/>  
and even Biddy used her hands to aid in throwing out the<lb/>  
water.</p>
            <p>“This is no time to hesitate, men,” said Spike, sternly.<lb/>  
“Everything must go overboard but the food and water.<lb/>  
Away with them at once, and with a will.”</p>
            <p>It was a proof how completely all hands were alarmed<lb/>  
by this, the first experiment in the breakers, that not a man<lb/>  
stayed his hand a single moment, but each threw into the<lb/>  
sea, without an instant of hesitation, every article he had<lb/>  
brought with him and had hoped to save. Biddy parted<lb/>  
with the carpet-bag, and Señor Montefalderon, feeling the<lb/>  
importance of example, committed to the deep a small<lb/>  
writing-desk that he had placed on his knees. The <lb/>doubloons alone remained, safe in a little locker where Spike<lb/>  
had deposited them along with his own.</p>
            <p>“What news astern, boatswain?” demanded the <lb/>captain, as soon as this imminent danger was passed, absolutely<lb/>  
afraid to turn his eyes off the dangers ahead for a single<lb/>  
instant. “How come on the man-of-war's men?”</p>
            <p>“They are running down in a body toward the wreck,<lb/>  
though one of their boats does seem to be sheering out of<lb/>  
the line, as if getting into our wake. It is hard to say, sir,<lb/>  
for they are still a good bit to windward of the wreck.”</p>
            <p>“And the Molly, Strand?”</p>
            <p>“Why, sir, the Molly seems to be breaking up fast; as<lb/>  
well as I can see, she has broke in two just abaft the <lb/>fore-chains, and cannot hold together in any shape at all many<lb/>  
minutes longer.”</p>
            <p>This information drew a deep groan from Spike, and the<lb/>  
eye of every seaman in the boat was turned in melancholy<lb/>  
on the object they were so fast leaving behind them. The<lb/>  
yawl could not be said to be sailing very rapidly, <lb/>considering the power of the wind, which was a little gale, for she<lb/>  
was much too deep for that, but she left the wreck so fast<lb/>  
as already to render objects on board her indistinct. <lb/>
               <pb n="175"/>Everybody saw that, like an overburthened steed, she had more<lb/>  
to get along with than she could well bear; and, <lb/>dependent as seamen usually are on the judgment and orders of<lb/>  
their superiors, even in the direst emergencies, the least<lb/>  
experienced man in her saw that their chances of final<lb/>  
escape from drowning were of the most doubtful nature.<lb/>  
The men looked at each other in a way to express their <lb/>feelings; and the moment seemed favourable to Spike to <lb/>confer with his confidential sea-dogs in private; but more<lb/>  
white water was also ahead, and it was necessary to pass<lb/>  
through it, since no opening was visible by which to avoid<lb/>  
it. He deferred his purpose, consequently, until this <lb/>danger was escaped.</p>
            <p>On this occasion Spike saw but little opportunity to<lb/>  
select a place to get through the breakers, though the<lb/>  
spot, as a whole, was not of the most dangerous kind. The<lb/>  
reader will understand that the preservation of the boat at<lb/>  
all, in white water, was owing to the circumstance that the<lb/>  
rocks all around it lay so near the surface of the sea as to<lb/>  
prevent the possibility of agitating the element very <lb/>seriously, and to the fact that she was near the lee side of the reef.<lb/>  
Had the breakers been of the magnitude of those which<lb/>  
are seen where the deep rolling billows of the ocean first<lb/>  
meet the weather side of shoals or rocks, a craft of that<lb/>  
size, and so loaded, could not possibly have passed the first<lb/>  
line of white water without filling. As it was, however,<lb/>  
the breakers she had to contend with were sufficiently <lb/>formidable, and they brought with them the certainty that the<lb/>  
boat was in imminent danger of striking the bottom at any<lb/>  
moment. Places like those in which Mulford had waded<lb/>  
on the reef, while it was calm, would now have proved<lb/>  
fatal to the strongest frame, since human powers were <lb/>insufficient long to withstand the force of such waves as did<lb/>  
glance over even these shallows.</p>
            <p>“Look out!” cried Spike, as the boat again plunged<lb/>  
in among the white water. “Keep bailing, men—keep<lb/>  
bailing.”</p>
            <p>The men did bail, and the danger was over almost as<lb/>  
soon as encountered. Something like a cheer burst out<lb/>  
of the chest of Spike, when he saw deeper water around<lb/>  
him, and fancied he could now trace a channel that would<lb/>
               <pb n="176"/>  
carry him quite beyond the extent of the reef. It was <lb/>arrested, only half uttered, however, by a communication<lb/>  
from the boatswain, who sat on a midship thwart, his arms<lb/>  
folded, and his eye on the brig and the boats.</p>
            <p>“There goes the Molly's masts, sir! Both have gone<lb/>  
together; and as good sticks was they, before them <lb/>bomb-shells passed through our rigging, as was ever stepped in a<lb/>  
keelson.”</p>
            <p>The cheer was changed to something like a groan, while<lb/>  
a murmur of regret passed through the boat.</p>
            <p>“What news from the man-of-war's men, boatswain?<lb/>  
Do they still stand down on a mere wreck?”</p>
            <p>“No, sir; they seem to give it up, and are getting out<lb/>  
their oars to pull back to their ship. A pretty time they'll<lb/>  
have of it, too. The cutter that gets to windward half a<lb/>  
mile in an hour, ag'in such a sea, and such a breeze, must<lb/>  
be well pulled and better steered. One chap, however,<lb/>  
sir, seems to hold on.”</p>
            <p>Spike now ventured to look behind him, commanding<lb/>  
an experienced hand to take the helm. In order to do this<lb/>  
he was obliged to change places with the man he had<lb/>  
selected to come aft, which brought him on a thwart <lb/>alongside of the boatswain and one or two other of his <lb/>confidants. Here a whispered conference took place, which<lb/>  
lasted several minutes, Spike appearing to be giving <lb/>instructions to the men.</p>
            <p>By this time the yawl was more than a mile from the<lb/>  
wreck, all the man-of-war boats but one had lowered their<lb/>  
sails, and were pulling slowly and with great labour back<lb/>  
toward the ship, the cutter that kept on, evidently laying<lb/>  
her course after the yawl, instead of standing on toward<lb/>  
the wreck. The brig was breaking up fast, with every<lb/>  
probability that nothing would be left of her in a few more<lb/>  
minutes. As for the yawl, while clear of the white water,<lb/>  
it got along without receiving many seas aboard, though<lb/>  
the men in its bottom were kept bailing without <lb/>intermission. It appeared to Spike that so long as they remained<lb/>  
on the reef, and could keep clear of breakers—a most <lb/>difficult thing, however—they should fare better than if in<lb/>  
deeper water, where the swell of the sea, and the combing<lb/>  
of the waves, menaced so small and so deep-loaded a craft<lb/>
               <pb n="177"/>  
with serious danger. As it was, two or three men could<lb/>  
barely keep the boat clear, working incessantly, and much<lb/>  
of the time with a foot or two of water in her.</p>
            <p>Josh and Simon had taken their seats, side by side, with<lb/>  
that sort of dependence and submission that causes the<lb/>  
American black to abstain from mingling with the whites<lb/>  
more than might appear seemly. They were squeezed on<lb/>  
to one end of the thwart by a couple of robust old sea-dogs,<lb/>  
who were two of the very men with whom Spike had been<lb/>  
in consultation. Beneath that very thwart was stowed<lb/>  
another confidant, to whom communications had also been<lb/>  
made. These men had sailed long in the Swash, and<lb/>  
having been picked up in various ports, from time to time,<lb/>  
as the brig had wanted hands, they were of nearly as many<lb/>  
different nations as they were persons. Spike had <lb/>obtained a great ascendency over them by habit and <lb/>authority, and his suggestions were now received as a sort of law.<lb/>  
As soon as the conference was ended, the captain returned<lb/>  
to the helm.</p>
            <p>A minute more passed, during which the captain was<lb/>  
anxiously surveying the reef ahead, and the state of things<lb/>  
astern. Ahead was more white water—the last before they<lb/>  
should get clear of the reef; and astern it was now settled<lb/>  
that the cutter that held on through the dangers of the<lb/>  
place, was in chase of the yawl. That Mulford was in her<lb/>  
Spike made no doubt; and the thought embittered even<lb/>  
his present calamities. But the moment had arrived for<lb/>  
something decided. The white water ahead was much<lb/>  
more formidable than any they had passed; and the <lb/>boldest seamen there gazed at it with dread. Spike made a<lb/>  
sign to the boatswain, and commenced the execution of his<lb/>  
dire project.</p>
            <p>“I say, you Josh,” called out the captain, in the <lb/>authoritative tones that are so familiar to all on board a ship,<lb/>  
“pull in that fender that is dragging alongside.”</p>
            <p>Josh leaned over the gunwale, and reported that there<lb/>  
was no fender out. A malediction followed, also so <lb/>familiar to those acquainted with ships, and the black was told<lb/>  
to look again. This time, as had been expected, the negro<lb/>  
leaned with his head and body far over the side of the yawl,<lb/>  
to look for that which had no existence, when two of the<lb/>
               <pb n="178"/>  
men beneath the thwart shoved his legs after them. Josh<lb/>  
screamed, as he found himself going into the water, with<lb/>  
a sort of confused consciousness of the truth; and Spike<lb/>  
called out to Simon to “catch hold of his brother-nigger.”<lb/>  
The cook bent forward to obey, when a similar assault on<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">his</hi> legs from beneath the thwart, sent him headlong after<lb/>  
Josh. One of the younger seamen, who was not in the<lb/>  
secret, sprang up to rescue Simon, who grasped his extended<lb/>  
hand, when the too generous fellow was pitched headlong<lb/>  
from the boat.</p>
            <p>All this occurred in less than ten seconds of time, and<lb/>  
so unexpectedly and naturally, that not a soul beyond those<lb/>  
who were in the secret, had the least suspicion it was <lb/>anything but an accident. Some water was shipped, of <lb/>necessity, but the boat was soon bailed free. As for the victims<lb/>  
of this vile conspiracy, they disappeared amid the troubled<lb/>  
waters of the reef, struggling with each other. Each and<lb/>  
all met the common fate so much the sooner, from the<lb/>  
manner in which they impeded their own efforts.</p>
            <p>The yawl was now relieved from about five hundred<lb/>  
pounds of the weight it had carried—Simon weighing two<lb/>  
hundred alone, and the youngish seaman being large and<lb/>  
full. So intense does human selfishness get to be, in<lb/>  
moments of great emergency, that it is to be feared most<lb/>  
of those who remained, secretly rejoiced that they were so<lb/>  
far benefited by the loss of their fellows. The Señor<lb/>  
Montefalderon was seated on the aftermost thwart, with his<lb/>  
legs in the stern-sheets, and consequently with his back<lb/>  
toward the negroes, and he fully believed that what had<lb/>  
happened was purely accidental.</p>
            <p>“Let us lower our sail, Don Esteban,” he cried, eagerly,<lb/>  
“and save the poor fellows.”</p>
            <p>Something very like a sneer gleamed on the dark <lb/>countenance of the captain, but it suddenly changed to a look<lb/>  
of assent.</p>
            <p>“Good!” he said, hastily—“spring forward, Don Wan,<lb/>  
and lower the sail—stand by the oars, men!”</p>
            <p>Without pausing to reflect, the generous-hearted <lb/>Mexican stepped on a thwart, and began to walk rapidly forward,<lb/>  
steadying himself by placing his hands on the heads of the<lb/>  
men. He was suffered to get as far as the second thwart<lb/>
               <pb n="179"/>  
or past most of the conspirators, when his legs were seized<lb/>  
from behind. The truth now flashed on him, and grasping<lb/>  
two of the men in his front, who knew nothing of Spike's<lb/>  
dire scheme, he endeavoured to save himself by holding to<lb/>  
their jackets. Thus assailed, those men seized others<lb/>  
with like intent, and an awful struggle filled all that part<lb/>  
of the craft. At this dread instant the boat glanced into<lb/>  
the white water, shipping so much of the element as nearly<lb/>  
to swamp her, and taking so wild a sheer as nearly to<lb/>  
broach-to. This last circumstance probably saved her,<lb/>  
fearful as was the danger for the moment. Everybody in<lb/>  
the middle of the yawl was rendered desperate by the<lb/>  
amount and nature of the danger incurred, and the men<lb/>  
from the bottom rose in their might, underneath the <lb/>combatants, when a common plunge was made by all who stood<lb/>  
erect, one dragging overboard another, each a good deal<lb/>  
hastened by the assault from beneath, until no less than<lb/>  
five were gone. Spike got his helm up, the boat fell off,<lb/>  
and away from the spot it flew, clearing the breakers, and<lb/>  
reaching the northern wall-like margin of the reef at the<lb/>  
next instant. There was now a moment when those who<lb/>  
remained could breathe, and dared to look behind them.</p>
            <p>The great plunge had been made in water so shoal, that<lb/>  
the boat had barely escaped being dashed to pieces on the<lb/>  
coral. Had it not been so suddenly relieved from the<lb/>  
pressure of near a thousand pounds in weight, it is <lb/>probable that this calamity would have befallen it, the water<lb/>  
received on board contributing so much to weight it down.<lb/>  
The struggle between these victims ceased, however, the<lb/>  
moment they went over. Finding bottom for their feet,<lb/>  
they released each other, in a desperate hope of prolonging<lb/>  
life by wading. Two or three held out their arms, and<lb/>  
shouted to Spike to return and pick them up. This <lb/>dreadful scene lasted but a single instant, for the waves dashed<lb/>  
one after another from his feet, continually forcing them<lb/>  
all, as they occasionally regained their footing, toward the<lb/>  
margin of the reef, and finally washing them off it into<lb/>  
deep water. No human power could enable a man to swim<lb/>  
back to the rocks, once to leeward of them, in the face of<lb/>  
such seas, and so heavy a blow; and the miserable wretches<lb/>
               <pb n="180"/>  
disappeared in succession, as their strength became <lb/>exhausted, in the depths of the Gulf.</p>
            <p>Not a word had been uttered while this terrific scene<lb/>  
was in the course of occurrence; not a word was uttered<lb/>  
for some time afterward. Gleams of grim satisfaction had<lb/>  
been seen on the countenances of the boatswain and his<lb/>  
associates, when the success of their nefarious project was<lb/>  
first assured; but they soon disappeared in looks of horror,<lb/>  
as they witnessed the struggles of the drowning men.<lb/>  
Nevertheless, human selfishness was strong within them<lb/>  
all, and none there was so ignorant as not to perceive how<lb/>  
much better were the chances of the yawl now than it had<lb/>  
been on quitting the wreck. The weight of a large ox<lb/>  
had been taken from it, counting that of all the eight men<lb/>  
drowned; and as for the water shipped, it was soon bailed<lb/>  
back again into the sea. Not only, therefore, was the<lb/>  
yawl in a better condition to resist the waves, but it sailed<lb/>  
materially faster than it had done before. Ten persons<lb/>  
still remained in it, however, which brought it down in the<lb/>  
water below its proper load-line; and the speed of a craft<lb/>  
so small was necessarily a good deal lessened by the least<lb/>  
deviation from its best sailing, or rowing trim. But Spike's<lb/>  
projects were not yet completed.</p>
            <p>All this time the man-of-war's cutter had been rushing<lb/>  
as madly through the breakers, in chase, as the yawl had<lb/>  
done in the attempt to escape. Mulford was, in fact, on<lb/>  
board it; and his now fast friend, Wallace, was in <lb/>command. The latter wished to seize a traitor, the former to<lb/>  
save the aunt of his weeping bride. Both believed that<lb/>  
they might follow wherever Spike dared to lead. This<lb/>  
reasoning was more bold than judicious notwithstanding,<lb/>  
since the cutter was much larger, and drew twice as much<lb/>  
water as the yawl. On it came, nevertheless, faring much<lb/>  
better in the white water than the little craft it pursued,<lb/>  
but necessarily running a much more considerable risk of<lb/>  
hitting the coral, over which it was glancing almost as<lb/>  
swiftly as the waves themselves; still it had thus far<lb/>  
escaped—and little did any in it think of the danger. This<lb/>  
cutter pulled ten oars; was an excellent sea boat; had four<lb/>  
armed marines in it, in addition to its crew, but carried all<lb/>  
through the breakers, receiving scarcely a drop of water<lb/>
               <pb n="181"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
on board, on account of the height of its wash-boards, and<lb/>  
the general qualities of the craft. It may be well to add<lb/>  
here, that the Poughkeepsie had shaken out her reefs, and<lb/>  
was betraying the impatience of Captain Mull to make sail<lb/>  
in chase, by firing signal-guns to his boats to bear a hand<lb/>  
and return. These signals the three boats under their oars<lb/>  
were endeavouring to obey, but Wallace had got so far to<lb/>  
leeward as now to render the course he was pursuing the<lb/>  
wisest.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Budd and Biddy had seen the struggle in which<lb/>  
the Señor Montefalderon had been lost, in a sort of stupid<lb/>  
horror. Both had screamed, as was their wont, though<lb/>  
neither probably suspected the truth. But the fell designs<lb/>  
of Spike extended to them, as well as to those whom he<lb/>  
had already destroyed. Now the boat was in deep water,<lb/>  
running along the margin of the reef, the waves were much<lb/>  
increased in magnitude, and the comb of the sea was far<lb/>  
more menacing to the boat. This would not have been<lb/>  
the case had the rocks formed a lee; but they did not,<lb/>  
running too near the direction of the trades to prevent the<lb/>  
billows that got up a mile or so in the offing, from sending<lb/>  
their swell quite home to the reef. It was this swell, <lb/>indeed, which caused the line of white water along the <lb/>northern margin of the coral, washing on the rocks by a sort<lb/>  
of lateral effort, and breaking, as a matter of course. In<lb/>  
many places, no boat could have lived to pass through it.</p>
            <p>Another consideration influenced Spike to persevere.<lb/>  
The cutter had been overhauling him, hand over hand, but<lb/>  
since the yawl was relieved of the weight of no less than<lb/>  
eight men, the difference in the rate of sailing was <lb/>manifestly diminished. The man-of-war's boat drew nearer,<lb/>  
but by no means as fast as it had previously done. A<lb/>  
point was now reached in the trim of the yawl, when a<lb/>  
very few hundreds in weight might make the most <lb/>important change in her favour; and this change the captain was<lb/>  
determined to produce. By this time the cutter was in<lb/>  
deep water, as well as himself, safe through all the dangers<lb/>  
of the reef, and she was less than a quarter of a mile astern.<lb/>  
On the whole, she was gaining, though so slowly as to <lb/>require the most experienced eye to ascertain the fact.</p>
            <p>“Madame Budd,” said Spike, in a hypocritical tone,<lb/>
               <pb n="182"/>  
“we are in great danger, and I shall have to ask you to<lb/>  
change your seat. The boat is too much by the starn,<lb/>  
now we've got into deep water, and your weight amidships<lb/>  
would be a great relief to us. Just give your hand to the<lb/>  
boatswain, and he will help you to step from thwart to<lb/>  
thwart, until you reach the right place, when Biddy shall<lb/>  
follow.”</p>
            <p>Now Mrs. Budd had witnessed the tremendous struggle<lb/>  
in which so many had gone overboard, but so dull was she<lb/>  
of apprehension, and so little disposed to suspect anything<lb/>  
one-half so monstrous as the truth, that she did not hesitate<lb/>  
to comply. She was profoundly awed by the horrors of<lb/>  
the scene through which she was passing, the raging <lb/>billows of the Gulf, as seen from so small a craft, producing<lb/>  
a deep impression on her; still a lingering of her most <lb/>inveterate affectation was to be found in her air and <lb/>language, which presented a strange medley of besetting <lb/>weakness, and strong, natural, womanly affection.</p>
            <p>“Certainly, Captain Spike,” she answered, rising. “A<lb/>  
craft should never go astern, and I am quite willing to <lb/>ballast the boat. We have seen such terrible accidents <lb/>today, that all should lend their aid in endeavouring to get<lb/>  
under way, and in averting all possible hamper. Only<lb/>  
take me to my poor, dear Rosy, Captain Spike, and <lb/>everything shall be forgotten that has passed between us. This<lb/>  
is not a moment to bear malice; and I freely pardon you<lb/>  
all and everything. The fate of our unfortunate friend,<lb/>  
Mr. Montefalderon, should teach us charity, and cause us<lb/>  
to prepare for untimely ends.”</p>
            <p>All the time the good widow was making this speech,<lb/>  
which she uttered in a solemn and oracular sort of manner,<lb/>  
she was moving slowly toward the seat the men had <lb/>prepared for her, in the middle of the boat, assisted with the<lb/>  
greatest care and attention by the boatswain and another<lb/>  
of Spike's confidants. When on the second thwart from<lb/>  
aft, and about to take her seat, the boatswain cast a look<lb/>  
behind him, and Spike put the helm down. The boat<lb/>  
luffed and lurched, of course, and Mrs. Budd would <lb/>probably have gone overboard to leeward, by so sudden and<lb/>  
violent a change, had not the impetus thus received been<lb/>  
aided by the arms of the men who held her two hands.<lb/>
               <pb n="183"/>  
The plunge she made into the water was deep, for she was<lb/>  
a woman of great weight for her stature. Still, she was<lb/>  
not immediately gotten rid of. Even at that dread instant,<lb/>  
it is probable that the miserable woman did not suspect<lb/>  
the truth, for she grasped the hand of the boatswain with<lb/>  
the tenacity of a vice, and, thus dragged on the surface of<lb/>  
the boiling surges, she screamed aloud for Spike to save<lb/>  
her. Of all who had yet been sacrificed to the captain's<lb/>  
selfish wish to save himself, this was the first instance in<lb/>  
which any had been heard to utter a sound, after falling<lb/>  
into the sea. The appeal shocked even the rude beings<lb/>  
around her, and Biddy chiming in with a powerful appeal<lb/>  
to “save the missus!” added to the piteous nature of the<lb/>  
scene.</p>
            <p>“Cast off her hand,” said Spike reproachfully, “she'll<lb/>  
swamp the boat by her struggles—get rid of her at once!<lb/>  
Cut her fingers off, if she wont let go!”</p>
            <p>The instant these brutal orders were given, and that in<lb/>  
a fierce, impatient tone, the voice of Biddy was heard no<lb/>  
more. The truth forced itself on her dull imagination,<lb/>  
and she sat a witness of the terrible scene, in mute despair.<lb/>  
The struggle did not last long. The boatswain drew his<lb/>  
knife across the wrist of the hand that grasped his own,<lb/>  
one shriek was heard, and the boat plunged into the trough<lb/>  
of a sea, leaving the form of poor Mrs. Budd struggling<lb/>  
with the wave on its summit, and amid the foam of its<lb/>  
crest. This was the last that was ever seen of the <lb/>unfortunate relict.</p>
            <p>“The boat has gained a good deal by that last discharge<lb/>  
of cargo,” said Spike to the boatswain, a minute after they<lb/>  
had gotten rid of the struggling woman—“she is much<lb/>  
more lively, and is getting nearer to her load-line. If we<lb/>  
can bring her to <hi rend="italics">that,</hi> I shall have no fear of the <lb/>man-of-war's men; for this yawl is one of the fastest boats that<lb/>  
ever floated.”</p>
            <p>“A very little <hi rend="italics">now,</hi> sir, would bring us to our true<lb/>  
trim.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, we must get rid of more cargo. Come, good<lb/>  
woman,” turning to Biddy, with whom he did not think it<lb/>  
worth his while to use much circumlocution, “<hi rend="italics">your</hi> turn<lb/>  
is next. It's the maid's duty to follow her mistress.”</p>
            <pb n="184"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“I know'd it <hi rend="italics">must</hi> come,” said Biddy, meekly. “If there<lb/>  
was no mercy for the missus, little could I look for. But<lb/>  
ye'll not take the life of a Christian woman widout giving<lb/>  
her so much as one minute to say her prayers?”</p>
            <p>“Ay, pray away,” answered Spike, his throat becoming<lb/>  
dry and husky, for, strange to say, the submissive quiet of<lb/>  
the Irish woman, so different from the struggle he had <lb/>anticipated with <hi rend="italics">her,</hi> rendered him more reluctant to proceed<lb/>  
than he had hitherto been in all of that terrible day. As<lb/>  
Biddy kneeled in the bottom of the stern-sheets, Spike<lb/>  
looked behind him, for the double purpose of escaping the<lb/>  
painful spectacle at his feet, and that of ascertaining how<lb/>  
his pursuers came on. The last still gained, though very<lb/>  
slowly, and doubts began to come over the captain's mind<lb/>  
whether he could escape such enemies at all. He was too<lb/>  
deeply committed, however, to recede, and it was most<lb/>  
desirable to get rid of poor Biddy, if it were for no other<lb/>  
motive than to shut her mouth. Spike even fancied that<lb/>  
some idea of what had passed was entertained by those in<lb/>  
the cutter. There was evidently a stir in that boat, and<lb/>  
two forms that he had no difficulty, now, in recognizing as<lb/>  
those of Wallace and Mulford, were standing on the <lb/>grating in the eyes of the cutter, or forward of the foresail.<lb/>  
The former appeared to have a musket in his hand, and<lb/>  
the other a glass. The last circumstance admonished him<lb/>  
that all that was now done would be done before dangerous<lb/>  
witnesses. It was too late to draw back, however, and the<lb/>  
captain turned to look for the Irish woman.</p>
            <p>Biddy arose from her knees, just as Spike withdrew his<lb/>  
eyes from his pursuers. The boatswain and another <lb/>confidant were in readiness to cast the poor creature into the<lb/>  
sea, the moment their leader gave the signal. The <lb/>intended victim saw and understood the arrangement, and<lb/>  
she spoke earnestly and piteously to her murderers.</p>
            <p>“It's not wanting will be violence!” said Biddy, in a<lb/>  
quiet tone, but with a saddened countenance. “I know<lb/>  
it's my turn, and I will save yer sowls from a part of the<lb/>  
burden of this great sin. God, and His Divine Son, and<lb/>  
the Blessed Mother of Jesus have mercy on me if it be<lb/>  
wrong; but I would far radder jump into the saa widout<lb/>  
having the rude hands of man on me, than have the <lb/>
               <pb n="185"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>dreadful sight of the missus done over ag'in. It's a fearful thing<lb/>  
is wather, and sometimes we have too little of it, and <lb/>sometimes more than we want—”</p>
            <p>“Bear a hand, bear a hand, good woman,” interrupted<lb/>  
the boatswain, impatiently. “We must clear the boat of<lb/>  
you, and the sooner it is done the better it will be for all<lb/>  
of us.”</p>
            <p>“Don't grudge a poor morthal half a minute of life, at<lb/>  
the last moment,” answered Biddy. “It's not long that<lb/>  
I'll throuble ye, and so no more need be said.”</p>
            <p>The poor creature then got on the quarter of the boat,<lb/>  
without any one's touching her; there she placed herself<lb/>  
with her legs outboard, while she sat on the gunwale. She<lb/>  
gave one moment to the thought of arranging her clothes<lb/>  
with womanly decency, and then she paused to gaze with<lb/>  
a fixed eye, and pallid cheek, on the foaming wake that<lb/>  
marked the rapid course of the boat. The troughs of the<lb/>  
sea seemed less terrible to her than their combing crests,<lb/>  
and she waited for the boat to descend into the next.</p>
            <p>“God forgive ye all, this deed, as I do!” said Biddy,<lb/>  
earnestly, and bending her person forward, she fell, as it<lb/>  
might be “without hands,” into the gulf of eternity.<lb/>  
Though all strained their eyes, none of the men, Jack Tier<lb/>  
excepted, ever saw more of Biddy Noon. Nor did Jack<lb/>  
see much. He got a frightful glimpse of an arm, however,<lb/>  
on the summit of a wave, but the motion of the boat was<lb/>  
too swift, and the water of the ocean too troubled, to admit<lb/>  
of aught else.</p>
            <p>A long pause succeeded this event. Biddy's quiet <lb/>submission to her fate had produced more impression on her<lb/>  
murderers than the desperate, but unavailing, struggles of<lb/>  
those who had preceded her. Thus it is ever with men.<lb/>  
When opposed, the demon within blinds them to <lb/>consequences as well as to their duties; but, unresisted, the<lb/>  
silent influence of the image of God makes itself felt, and<lb/>  
a better spirit begins to prevail. There was not one in<lb/>  
that boat who did not, for a brief space, wish that poor<lb/>  
Biddy had been spared. With most, that feeling, the last<lb/>  
of human kindness they ever knew, lingered until the <lb/>occurrence of the dread catastrophe which, so shortly after,<lb/>  
closed the scene of this state of being on their eyes.</p>
            <pb n="186"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“Jack Tier,” called out Spike, some five minutes after<lb/>  
Biddy was drowned, but not until another observation had<lb/>  
made it plainly apparent to him that the man-of-war's men<lb/>  
still continued to draw nearer, being now not more than<lb/>  
fair musket-shot astern.</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay, sir,” answered Jack, coming quietly out of his<lb/>  
hole, from forward of the mast, and moving aft as if <lb/>indifferent to the danger, by stepping lightly from thwart to<lb/>  
thwart, until he reached the stern-sheets.</p>
            <p>“It is your turn, little Jack,” said Spike, as if in a sort<lb/>  
of sorrowful submission to a necessity that knew no law,<lb/>  
“we cannot spare you the room.”</p>
            <p>“I have expected this, and am ready. Let me have my<lb/>  
own way, and I will cause you no trouble. Poor Biddy<lb/>  
has taught me how to die. Before I go, however, Stephen<lb/>  
Spike, I must leave you this letter. It is written by <lb/>myself, and addressed to you. When I am gone, read it, and<lb/>  
think well of what it contains. And now, may a merciful<lb/>  
God pardon the sins of both, through love for His Divine<lb/>  
Son. I forgive you, Stephen; and should you live to<lb/>  
escape from those who are now bent on hunting you to the<lb/>  
death, let this day cause you no grief on my account.<lb/>  
Give me but a moment of time, and I will cause you no<lb/>  
trouble.”</p>
            <p>Jack now stood upon the seat of the stern-sheets, <lb/>balancing himself with one foot on the stern of the boat. He<lb/>  
waited until the yawl had risen to the summit of a wave,<lb/>  
when he looked eagerly for the man-of-war's cutter. At<lb/>  
that moment she was lost to view in the trough of the sea.<lb/>  
Instead of springing overboard, as all expected, he asked<lb/>  
another instant of delay. The yawl sank into the trough<lb/>  
itself, and rose on the succeeding billow. Then he saw<lb/>  
the cutter, and Wallace and Mulford standing in its bows.<lb/>  
He waved his hat to them, and sprang high into the air,<lb/>  
with the intent to make himself seen; when he came down<lb/>  
the boat had shot her length away from the place, leaving<lb/>  
him to buffet with the waves. Jack now managed <lb/>admirably, swimming lightly and easily, but keeping his eyes on<lb/>  
the crests of the waves, with a view to meet the cutter.<lb/>  
Spike now saw this well-planned project to avoid death,<lb/>  
and regretted his own remissness in not making sure of<lb/>
               <pb n="187"/>  
Jack. Everybody in the yawl was eagerly looking after<lb/>  
the form of Tier.</p>
            <p>“There he is on the comb of that sea, rolling over like<lb/>  
a keg!” cried the boatswain.</p>
            <p>“He 's through it,” answered Spike, “and swimming<lb/>  
with great strength and coolness.”</p>
            <p>Several of the men started up involuntarily and <lb/>simultaneously to look, hitting their shoulders and bodies <lb/>together. Distrust was at its most painful height; and <lb/>bull-dogs do not spring at the ox's muzzle more fiercely than<lb/>  
those six men throttled each other. Oaths, curses, and<lb/>  
appeals for help, succeeded; each man endeavouring, in<lb/>  
his frenzied efforts, to throw all the others overboard, as<lb/>  
the only means of saving himself. Plunge succeeded<lb/>  
plunge; and when that combat of demons ended, no one<lb/>  
remained of them all but the boatswain. Spike had taken<lb/>  
no share in the struggle, looking on in grim satisfaction,<lb/>  
as the Father of Lies may be supposed to regard all human<lb/>  
strife, hoping good to himself, let the result be what it<lb/>  
might to others. Of the five men who thus went overboard,<lb/>  
not one escaped. They drowned each other by continuing<lb/>  
their maddened conflict in an element unsuited to their<lb/>  
natures.</p>
            <p>Not so with Jack Tier. His leap had been seen, and a<lb/>  
dozen eyes in the cutter watched for his person, as that boat<lb/>  
came foaming down before the wind. A shout of “There<lb/>  
he is!” from Mulford succeeded; and the little fellow was<lb/>  
caught by the hair, secured, and then hauled into the boat<lb/>  
by the second lieutenant of the Poughkeepsie and our<lb/>  
young mate.</p>
            <p>Others in the cutter had noted the incident of the hellish<lb/>  
fight. The fact was communicated to Wallace, and <lb/>Mulford said, “That yawl will outsail this loaded cutter, with<lb/>  
only two men in it.”</p>
            <p>“Then it is time to try what virtue there is in lead,”<lb/>  
answered Wallace. “Marines, come forward, and give<lb/>  
the rascal a volley.”</p>
            <p>The volley was fired; one ball passed through the head<lb/>  
of the boatswain, killing him dead on the spot. Another<lb/>  
went through the body of Spike. The captain fell in the<lb/>  
stern-sheets, and the boat instantly broached-to.</p>
            <pb n="188"/>
            <p/>
            <p>The water that came on board apprised Spike fully of<lb/>  
the state in which he was now placed, and by a desperate<lb/>  
effort, he clutched the tiller, and got the yawl again before<lb/>  
the wind. This could not last, however. Little by little,<lb/>  
his hold relaxed, until his hand relinquished its grasp <lb/>altogether, and the wounded man sank into the bottom of the<lb/>  
stern-sheets, unable to raise even his head. Again the<lb/>  
boat broached-to. Every sea now sent its water aboard,<lb/>  
and the yawl would soon have filled, had not the cutter<lb/>  
come glancing down past it, and rounding-to under its lee,<lb/>  
secured the prize.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> has now become necessary to advance the time three<lb/>  
entire days, and to change the scene to Key West. As<lb/>  
this latter place may not be known to the world at large,<lb/>  
it may be well to explain that it is a small seaport, situate<lb/>  
on one of the largest of the many low islands that dot the<lb/>  
Florida Reef, that has risen into notice, or indeed into<lb/>  
existence as a town, since the acquisition of the Floridas by<lb/>  
the American Republic. For many years it was the resort of<lb/>  
few besides wreckers, and those who live by the business<lb/>  
dependent on the rescuing and repairing of stranded <lb/>vessels, not forgetting the salvages. When it is remembered<lb/>  
that the greater portion of the vessels that enter the Gulf<lb/>
               <pb n="189"/>  
of Mexico stand close along this reef, before the trades,<lb/>  
for a distance varying from one to two hundred miles, and<lb/>  
that nearly everything which quits it, is obliged to beat<lb/>  
down its rocky coast in the Gulf Stream for the same <lb/>distance, one is not to be surprised that the wrecks, which so<lb/>  
constantly occur, can supply the wants of a considerable<lb/>  
population. To live at Key West is the next thing to<lb/>  
being at sea. The place has sea air, no other water than<lb/>  
such as is preserved in cisterns, and no soil, or so little as<lb/>  
to render even a head of lettuce a rarity. Turtle is <lb/>abundant, and the business of “turtling” forms an occupation<lb/>  
additional to that of wrecking. As might be expected, in<lb/>  
such circumstances, a potato is a far more precious thing<lb/>  
than a turtle's egg, and a sack of the tubers would <lb/>probably be deemed a sufficient remuneration for enough of<lb/>  
the materials of callipash and callipee to feed all the <lb/>aldermen extant.</p>
            <p>Of late years, the government of the United States has<lb/>  
turned its attention to the capabilities of the Florida Reef,<lb/>  
as an advanced naval station; a sort of Downs, or St.<lb/>  
Helen's Roads, for the West Indian seas. As yet little<lb/>  
has been done beyond making the preliminary surveys, but<lb/>  
the day is not probably very distant when fleets will lie at<lb/>  
anchor among the islets described in our earlier chapters,<lb/>  
or garnish the fine waters of Key West. For a long time<lb/>  
it was thought that even frigates would have a difficulty in<lb/>  
entering and quitting the port of the latter, but it is said<lb/>  
that recent explorations have discovered channels capable<lb/>  
of admitting anything that floats. Still Key West is a<lb/>  
town yet in its chrysalis state, possessing the promise rather<lb/>  
than the fruition of the prosperous days which are in <lb/>reserve. It may be well to add, that it lies a very little north<lb/>  
of the 24th degree of latitude, and in a longitude quite<lb/>  
five degrees west from Washington. Until the recent <lb/>conquests in Mexico it was the most southern possession of<lb/>  
the American government, on the eastern side of the <lb/>continent; Cape St. Lucas, at the extremity of Lower <lb/>California, however, being two degrees farther south.</p>
            <p>It will give the foreign reader a more accurate notion<lb/>  
of the character of Key West, if we mention a fact of<lb/>  
quite recent occurrence. A very few weeks after the<lb/>
               <pb n="190"/>  
closing scenes of this tale, the town in question was, in a<lb/>  
great measure, washed away! A hurricane brought in the<lb/>  
sea upon all these islands and reefs, water running in swift<lb/>  
currents over places that within the memory of man were<lb/>  
never before submerged. The lower part of Key West<lb/>  
was converted into a raging sea, and everything in that<lb/>  
quarter of the place disappeared. The foundation being<lb/>  
of rock, however, when the ocean retired the island came<lb/>  
into view again, and industry and enterprise set to work to<lb/>  
repair the injuries.</p>
            <p>The government has established a small hospital for <lb/>seamen at Key West. Into one of the rooms of the building<lb/>  
thus appropriated our narrative must now conduct the<lb/>  
reader. It contained but a single patient, and that was<lb/>  
Spike. He was on his narrow bed, which was to be but<lb/>  
the pucursor of a still narrower tenement, the grave. In<lb/>  
the room with the dying man were two females, in one of<lb/>  
whom our readers will at once recognize the person of<lb/>  
Rose Budd, dressed in deep mourning for her aunt. At<lb/>  
first sight, it is probable that a casual spectator would <lb/>mistake the second female for one of the ordinary nurses of<lb/>  
the place. Her attire was well enough, though worn<lb/>  
awkwardly, and as if its owner were not exactly at ease in<lb/>  
it. She had the air of one in her best attire, who was <lb/>unaccustomed to be dressed above the most common mode.<lb/>  
What added to the singularity of her appearance, was the<lb/>  
fact, that while she wore no cap, her hair had been cut<lb/>  
into short, gray bristles, instead of being long, and turned<lb/>  
up, as is usual with females. To give a sort of climax<lb/>  
to this uncouth appearance, this strange-looking creature<lb/>  
chewed tobacco.</p>
            <p>The woman in question, equivocal as might be her <lb/>exterior, was employed in one of the commonest avocations of<lb/>  
her sex—that of sewing. She held in her hand a coarse<lb/>  
garment, one of Spike's, in fact, which she seemed to be<lb/>  
intently busy in mending; although the work was of a<lb/>  
quality that invited the use of the palm and sail-needle,<lb/>  
rather than that of the thimble and the smaller implement<lb/>  
known to seamstresses, the woman appeared awkward in<lb/>  
her business, as if her coarse-looking and dark hands <lb/>refused to lend themselves to an occupation so feminine.<lb/>
               <pb n="191"/>  
Nevertheless, there were touches of a purely womanly<lb/>  
character about this extraordinary person, and touches that<lb/>  
particularly attracted the attention, and awakened the <lb/>sympathy of the gentle Rose, her companion. Tears <lb/>occasionally struggled out from beneath her eyelids, crossed her<lb/>  
dark, sun-burnt cheek, and fell on the coarse canvas <lb/>garment that lay in her lap. It was after one of these sudden<lb/>  
and strong exhibitions of feeling that Rose approached her,<lb/>  
laid her own little, fair hand, in a friendly way, though <lb/>unheeded, on the other's shoulder, and spoke to her in her<lb/>  
kindest and softest tones.</p>
            <p>“I do really think he is reviving, Jack,” said Rose,<lb/>  
“and that you may yet hope to have an intelligent <lb/>conversation with him.”</p>
            <p>“They all agree he <hi rend="italics">must</hi> die,” answered Jack Tier—<lb/>  
for it was <hi rend="italics">he,</hi> appearing in the garb of his proper sex, after<lb/>  
a disguise that had now lasted fully twenty years—“and<lb/>  
he will never know who I am, and that I forgive him. He<lb/>  
must think of me in another world, though he is n't able<lb/>  
to do it in this; but it would be a great relief to his soul<lb/>  
to know that I forgive him.”</p>
            <p>“To be sure, a man must like to take a kind leave of<lb/>  
his own wife before he closes his eyes for ever; and I dare<lb/>  
say it would be a great relief to you to tell him that you<lb/>  
have forgotten his desertion of you, and all the hardships<lb/>  
it has brought upon you in searching for him, and in <lb/>earning your own livelihood as a common sailor.”</p>
            <p>“I shall not tell him I've <hi rend="italics">forgotten</hi> it, Miss Rose; that<lb/>  
would be untrue—and there shall be no more deception<lb/>  
between us; but I shall tell him that I <hi rend="italics">forgive</hi> him, as I<lb/>  
hope God will one day forgive me all <hi rend="italics">my</hi> sins.”</p>
            <p>“It is, certainly, not a light offence to desert a wife in a<lb/>  
foreign land, and then to seek to deceive another woman,”<lb/>  
quietly observed Rose.</p>
            <p>“He's a willian!” muttered the wife—“but—but—”</p>
            <p>“You forgive him, Jack—yes, I'm sure you do. You<lb/>  
are too good a Christian to refuse to forgive him.”</p>
            <p>“I'm a woman a'ter all, Miss Rose; and that, I believe,<lb/>  
is the truth of it. I suppose I ought to do as you say, for<lb/>  
the reason you mention; but I'm his wife—and once he<lb/>  
loved me, though that has long been over. When I first<lb/>
               <pb n="192"/>  
knew Stephen, I'd the sort of feelin's you speak of, and<lb/>  
was a very different creatur' from what you see me to-day.<lb/>  
Change comes over us all with years and sufferin'.”</p>
            <p>Rose did not answer, but she stood looking intently at<lb/>  
the speaker more than a minute. Change had, indeed,<lb/>  
come over her, if she had ever possessed the power to<lb/>  
please the fancy of any living man. Her features had<lb/>  
always seemed diminutive and mean for her assumed sex,<lb/>  
as her voice was small and cracked; but, making every<lb/>  
allowance for the probabilities, Rose found it difficult to<lb/>  
imagine that Jack Tier had ever possessed, even under the<lb/>  
high advantages of youth and innocence, the attractions<lb/>  
so common to her sex. Her skin had acquired the tanning<lb/>  
of the sea; the expression of her face had become hard<lb/>  
and worldly; and her habits contributed to render those<lb/>  
natural consequences of exposure and toil even more than<lb/>  
usually marked and decided. By saying “habits,” <lb/>however, we do not mean that Jack had ever drunk to excess,<lb/>  
as happens with so many seamen, for this would have been<lb/>  
doing her injustice, but she smoked and chewed—practices<lb/>  
that intoxicate in another form, and lead nearly as many to<lb/>  
the grave as excess in drinking. Thus all the accessories<lb/>  
about this singular being, partook of the character of her<lb/>  
recent life and duties. Her walk was between a waddle<lb/>  
and a seaman's roll, her hands were discoloured with tar,<lb/>  
and had got to be full of knuckles, and even her feet had<lb/>  
degenerated into that flat, broad-toed form that, perhaps,<lb/>  
sooner distinguishes caste, in connection with outward <lb/>appearances, than any one other physical peculiarity. Yet<lb/>  
this being <hi rend="italics">had</hi> once been young—had once been even <hi rend="italics">fair;  
 </hi>
               <lb/> and had once possessed that feminine air and lightness of<lb/>  
form, that as often belongs to the youthful American of her<lb/>  
sex, perhaps, as to the girl of any other nation on earth.<lb/>  
Rose continued to gaze at her companion for some time,<lb/>  
when she walked musingly to a window that looked out<lb/>  
upon the port.</p>
            <p>“I am not certain whether it would do him good or<lb/>  
not to see this sight,” she said, addressing the wife kindly,<lb/>  
doubtful of the effect of her words even on the latter.<lb/>  
“But here are the sloop-of-war, and several other vessels.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, she is <hi rend="italics">there;</hi> but never will his foot be put on<lb/>
               <pb n="193"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
board the Swash ag'in. When he bought that brig I was<lb/>  
still young, and agreeable to him; and he gave her my<lb/>  
maiden name, which was Mary, or Molly Swash. But<lb/>  
that is all changed; I wonder he did not change the name<lb/>  
with his change of feelin's.”</p>
            <p>“Then you did really sail in the brig in former times,<lb/>  
and knew the seaman whose name you assumed?”</p>
            <p>“Many years. Tier, with whose name I made free, on<lb/>  
account of his size, and some resemblance to me in form,<lb/>  
died under my care; and his protection fell into my hands,<lb/>  
which first put the notion into my head of hailing as his<lb/>  
representative. Yes, I knew Tier in the brig, and we<lb/>  
were left ashore at the same time; I, intentionally, I make<lb/>  
no question; he, because Stephen Spike was in a hurry,<lb/>  
and did not choose to wait for a man. The poor fellow<lb/>  
caught the yellow fever the very next day, and did not live<lb/>  
eight-and-forty hours. So the world goes; them that wish<lb/>  
to live, die; and them that wants to die, live!”</p>
            <p>“You have had a hard time for one of your sex, poor<lb/>  
Jack—quite twenty years a sailor, did you not tell me?”</p>
            <p>“Every day of it, Miss Rose—and bitter years have they<lb/>  
been; for the whole of that time have I been in chase of<lb/>  
my husband, keeping my own secret, and slaving like a<lb/>  
horse for a livelihood.”</p>
            <p>“You could not have been old when he left—that is—<lb/>  
when you parted.”</p>
            <p>“Call it by its true name, and say at once, when he <lb/>desarted me. I was under thirty by two or three years, and<lb/>  
was still like my own sex to look at. All <hi rend="italics">that</hi> is changed<lb/>  
since; but I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> comely <hi rend="italics">then</hi>.”</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="italics">Why</hi> did Captain Spike abandon you, Jack; you have<lb/>  
never told me <hi rend="italics">that</hi>.”</p>
            <p>“Because he fancied another. And ever since that time<lb/>  
he has been fancying others, instead of remembering me.<lb/>  
Had he got <hi rend="italics">you,</hi> Miss Rose, I think he would have been<lb/>  
content for the rest of his days.”</p>
            <p>“Be certain, Jack, I should never have consented to<lb/>  
marry Captain Spike.”</p>
            <p>“You're well out of his hands,” answered Jack, <lb/>sighing heavily, which was the most feminine thing she had<lb/>  
done during the whole conversation, “well out of his<lb/>
               <pb n="194"/>  
hands—and God be praised it is so. He should have died,<lb/>  
before I would let him carry you off the island—husband<lb/>  
or no husband.”</p>
            <p>“It might have exceeded your power to prevent it under<lb/>  
other circumstances, Jack.”</p>
            <p>Rose now continued looking out of the window in<lb/>  
silence. Her thoughts reverted to her aunt and Biddy,<lb/>  
and tears rolled down her cheeks as she remembered the<lb/>  
love of one, and the fidelity of the other. Their horrible<lb/>  
fate had given her a shock that, at first, menaced her with<lb/>  
a severe fit of illness; but her strong, good sense, and <lb/>excellent constitution, both sustained by her piety and Harry's<lb/>  
manly tenderness, had brought her through the danger, and<lb/>  
left her, as the reader now sees her, struggling with her<lb/>  
own griefs, in order to be of use to the still more unhappy<lb/>  
woman who had so singularly become her friend and <lb/>companion.</p>
            <p>The reader will readily have anticipated that Jack Tier<lb/>  
had early made the females on board the Swash her <lb/>confidants. Rose had known the outlines of her history from<lb/>  
the first few days they were at sea together, which is the<lb/>  
explanation of the visible intimacy that had caused <lb/>Mulford so much surprise. Jack's motive in making his <lb/>revelations might possibly have been tinctured with jealousy,<lb/>  
but a desire to save one as young and innocent as Rose<lb/>  
was at its bottom. Few persons but a wife would have<lb/>  
supposed our heroine could have been in any danger from<lb/>  
a lover like Spike; but Jack saw him with the eyes of her<lb/>  
own youth, and of past recollections, rather than with those<lb/>  
of truth. A movement of the wounded man first drew<lb/>  
Rose from the window. Drying her eyes hastily, she<lb/>  
turned toward him, fancying she might prove the better<lb/>  
nurse of the two, notwithstanding Jack's greater interest<lb/>  
in the patient.</p>
            <p>“What place is this—and why am I here?” demanded<lb/>  
Spike, with more strength of voice than could have been<lb/>  
expected, after all that had passed. “This is not a cabin<lb/>  
—not the Swash—it looks like a hospital.”</p>
            <p>“It is a hospital, Captain Spike,” said Rose, gently<lb/>  
drawing near the bed; “you have been hurt, and have<lb/>
               <pb n="195"/>  
been brought to Key West, and placed in the hospital. I<lb/>  
hope you feel better, and that you suffer no pain.”</p>
            <p>“My head is n't right—I do n't know—everything seems<lb/>  
turned round with me—perhaps it will all come out as it<lb/>  
should. I begin to remember—where is my brig?”</p>
            <p>“She is lost on the rocks. The seas have broken her<lb/>  
into fragments.”</p>
            <p>“That's melancholy news, at any rate. Ah! Miss Rose!<lb/>  
God bless you—I've had terrible dreams. Well, it's <lb/>pleasant to be among friends—what creature is that—where<lb/>  
does <hi rend="italics">she</hi> come from?”</p>
            <p>“That is Jack Tier,” answered Rose, steadily. “She<lb/>  
turns out to be a woman, and has put on her proper dress,<lb/>  
in order to attend on you during your illness. Jack has<lb/>  
never left your bedside since we have been here.”</p>
            <p>A long silence succeeded this revelation. Jack's eyes<lb/>  
twinkled, and she hitched her body half aside, as if to <lb/>conceal her features, where emotions that were unusual were<lb/>  
at work with the muscles. Rose thought it might be well<lb/>  
to leave the man and wife alone—and she managed to get<lb/>  
out of the room unobserved.</p>
            <p>Spike continued to gaze at the strange-looking female,<lb/>  
who was now his sole companion. Gradually his <lb/>recollection returned, and with it the full consciousness of his<lb/>  
situation. He might not have been fully aware of the<lb/>  
absolute certainty of his approaching death, but he must<lb/>  
have known that his wound was of a very grave character,<lb/>  
and that the result might early prove fatal. Still that<lb/>  
strange and unknown figure haunted him; a figure that<lb/>  
was so different from any he had ever seen before, and<lb/>  
which, in spite of its present dress, seemed to belong quite<lb/>  
as much to one sex as to the other. As for Jack, we call<lb/>  
Molly, or Mary Swash by her masculine appellation, not<lb/>  
only because it is more familiar, but because the other<lb/>  
name seems really out of place, as applied to such a person<lb/>  
—as for Jack, then, she sat with her face half averted,<lb/>  
thumbing the canvas, and endeavouring to ply the needle,<lb/>  
but perfectly mute. She was conscious that Spike's eyes<lb/>  
were on her; and a lingering feeling of her sex told her<lb/>  
how much time, exposure, and circumstances, had changed<lb/>
               <pb n="196"/>  
her person—and she would gladly have hidden the defects<lb/>  
in her appearance.</p>
            <p>Mary Swash was the daughter as well as the wife of a<lb/>  
ship-master. In her youth, as has been said before, she<lb/>  
had even been pretty, and down to the day when her <lb/>husband deserted her, she would have been thought a female<lb/>  
of a comely appearance rather than the reverse. Her hair<lb/>  
in particular, though slightly coarse, perhaps, had been<lb/>  
rich and abundant; and the change from the long, dark,<lb/>  
shining, flowing locks which she still possessed in her <lb/>thirtieth year, to the short, grey bristles that now stood exposed<lb/>  
without a cap, or covering of any sort, was one very likely<lb/>  
to destroy all identity of appearance. Then Jack had<lb/>  
passed from what might be called youth to the verge of old<lb/>  
age, in the interval that she had been separated from her<lb/>  
husband. Her shape had changed entirely; her <lb/>complexion was utterly gone; and her features, always <lb/>unmeaning, though feminine, and suitable to her sex, had become<lb/>  
hard and slightly coarse. Still there was something of her<lb/>  
former self about Jack that bewildered Spike; and his<lb/>  
eyes continued fastened on her for quite a quarter of an<lb/>  
hour in profound silence.</p>
            <p>“Give me some water,” said the wounded man, “I wish<lb/>  
some water to drink.”</p>
            <p>Jack arose, filled a tumbler and brought it to the side of<lb/>  
the bed. Spike took the glass and drank, but the whole<lb/>  
time his eyes were riveted on the strange nurse. When<lb/>  
his thirst was appeased, he asked—</p>
            <p>“Who are you? How came you here?”</p>
            <p>“I am your nurse. It is common to place nurses at the<lb/>  
bedsides of the sick.”</p>
            <p>“Are you man or woman?”</p>
            <p>“That is a question I hardly know how to answer. <lb/>Sometimes I think myself each; sometimes neither.”</p>
            <p>“Did I ever see you before?”</p>
            <p>“Often, and quite lately. I sailed with you in your last<lb/>  
voyage.”</p>
            <p>“You! That cannot be. If so, what is your name?”</p>
            <p>“Jack Tier.”</p>
            <p>A long pause succeeded this announcement, which <lb/>induced Spike to muse as intently as his condition would<lb/>
               <pb n="197"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
allow, though the truth did not yet flash on his <lb/>understanding. At length the bewildered man again spoke.</p>
            <p>“Are <hi rend="italics">you</hi> Jack Tier?” he said slowly, like one who<lb/>  
doubted. “Yes—I now see the resemblance, and it was<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">that</hi> which puzzled me. Are they so rigid in this hospital<lb/>  
that you have been obliged to put on woman's clothes in<lb/>  
order to lend me a helping hand?”</p>
            <p>“I am dressed as you see, and for good reasons.”</p>
            <p>“But Jack Tier run, like that rascal Mulford—ay, I <lb/>remember now; you were in the boat when I overhauled you<lb/>  
all on the reef.”</p>
            <p>“Very true; I was in the boat. But I never run, <lb/>Stephen Spike. It was <hi rend="italics">you</hi> who abandoned <hi rend="italics">me,</hi> on the islet<lb/>  
in the Gulf, and that makes the second time in your life<lb/>  
that you left me ashore, when it was your duty to carry me<lb/>  
to sea.”</p>
            <p>“The first time I was in a hurry, and could not wait<lb/>  
for you; this last time you took sides with the women.<lb/>  
But for your interference, I should have got Rose, and<lb/>  
married her, and all would now have been well with me.”</p>
            <p>This was an awkward announcement for a man to make<lb/>  
to his legal wife. But after all Jack had endured, and all<lb/>  
Jack had seen during the late voyage, she was not to be<lb/>  
overcome by this avowal. Her self-command extended so<lb/>  
far as to prevent any open manifestation of emotion, <lb/>however much her feelings were excited.</p>
            <p>“I took sides with the women, because I am a woman<lb/>  
myself,” she answered, speaking at length with decision,<lb/>  
as if determined to bring matters to a head at once. “It<lb/>  
is natural for us all to take sides with our kind.”</p>
            <p>“You a woman, Jack! That is very remarkable. Since<lb/>  
when have you hailed for a woman? You have shipped<lb/>  
with me twice, and each time as a man—though I've never<lb/>  
thought you able to do seaman's duty.”</p>
            <p>“Nevertheless, I am what you see; a woman born and<lb/>  
edicated; one that never had on man's dress until I knew<lb/>  
you. <hi rend="italics">You</hi> supposed me to be a man, when I came off to<lb/>  
you in the skiff to the eastward of Riker's Island, but I<lb/>  
was then what you now see.”</p>
            <p>“I begin to understand matters,” rejoined the invalid,<lb/>  
musingly. “Ay, ay, it opens on me; and I now see how<lb/>
               <pb n="198"/>  
it was you made such fair weather with Madam Budd and<lb/>  
pretty, pretty Rose. Rose <hi rend="italics">is</hi> pretty, Jack; you <hi rend="italics">must  
 </hi>
               <lb/> admit <hi rend="italics">that,</hi> though you be a woman.”</p>
            <p>“Rose <hi rend="italics">is</hi> pretty—I do admit it; and what is better,<lb/>  
Rose is <hi rend="italics">good.”</hi> It required a heavy draft on Jack's justice<lb/>  
and magnanimity, however, to make this concession.</p>
            <p>“And you told Rose and Madam Budd about your<lb/>  
sex; and that was the reason they took to you so on the<lb/>  
v'y'ge?”</p>
            <p>“I told them who I was, and why I went abroad as a<lb/>  
man. They know my whole story.”</p>
            <p>“Did Rose approve of your sailing under false colours,<lb/>  
Jack?”</p>
            <p>“You must ask that of Rose herself. My story made<lb/>  
her my friend; but she never said anything for or against<lb/>  
my disguise.”</p>
            <p>“It was no great disguise a'ter all, Jack. Now you're<lb/>  
fitted out in your own clothes, you've a sort of half-rigged<lb/>  
look; one would be as likely to set you down for a man<lb/>  
under jury-canvas, as for a woman.”</p>
            <p>Jack made no answer to this, but she sighed very heavily.<lb/>  
As for Spike himself, he was silent for some little time,<lb/>  
not only from exhaustion, but because he suffered pain from<lb/>  
his wound. The needle was diligently but awkwardly<lb/>  
plied in this pause.</p>
            <p>Spike's ideas were still a little confused; but a silence<lb/>  
and rest of a quarter of an hour cleared them materially.<lb/>  
At the end of that time he again asked for water. When<lb/>  
he had drunk, and Jack was once more seated, with his<lb/>  
side-face toward him, at work with the needle, the captain<lb/>  
gazed long and intently at this strange woman. It <lb/>happened that the profile of Jack preserved more of the <lb/>resemblance to her former self, than the full face; and it<lb/>  
was this resemblance that now attracted Spike's attention,<lb/>  
though not the smallest suspicion of the truth yet gleamed<lb/>  
upon him. He saw something that was familiar, though<lb/>  
he could not even tell what that something was, much less<lb/>  
to what or whom it bore any resemblance. At length he<lb/>  
spoke.</p>
            <p>“I was told that Jack Tier was dead,” he said; “that<lb/>  
he took the fever, and was in his grave within <lb/>
               <pb n="199"/>eight-and-forty hours after we sailed. That was what they told me<lb/>  
of <hi rend="italics">him</hi>.”</p>
            <p>“And what did they tell you of your own wife, <lb/>Stephen Spike. She that you left ashore at the time Jack<lb/>  
was left?”</p>
            <p>“They said she did not die for three years later. I heard<lb/>  
of her death at New Or<hi rend="italics">leens,</hi> three years later.”</p>
            <p>“And how could you leave her ashore—she, your true<lb/>  
and lawful wife?”</p>
            <p>“It was a bad thing,” answered Spike, who, like all<lb/>  
other mortals, regarded his own past career, now that he<lb/>  
stood on the edge of the grave, very differently from what<lb/>  
he had regarded it in the hour of his health and strength.<lb/>  
“Yes, it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a very bad thing; and I wish it was ondone.<lb/>  
But it is too late now. She died of the fever, too—that's<lb/>  
some comfort; had she died of a broken heart, I could not<lb/>  
have forgiven myself. Molly was not without her faults—<lb/>  
great faults, I considered them; but, on the whole, Molly<lb/>  
was a good creatur'.”</p>
            <p>“You liked her, then, Stephen Spike?”</p>
            <p>“I can truly say that when I married Molly, and old<lb/>  
Captain Swash put his da'ghter's hand into mine, that the<lb/>  
woman was n't living who was better in my judgment, or<lb/>  
handsomer in my eyes.”</p>
            <p>“Ay, ay—when you <hi rend="italics">married</hi> her; but how was it <lb/>a'terwards?—when you was tired of her, and saw another that<lb/>  
was fairer in your eyes?”</p>
            <p>“I desarted her; and God has punished me for the sin!<lb/>  
Do you know, Jack, that luck has never been with me<lb/>  
since that day. Often and often have I bethought me of<lb/>  
it; and sartain as you sit there, no great luck has ever been<lb/>  
with me, or my craft, since I went off, leaving my wife<lb/>  
ashore. What was made in one v'y'ge, was lost in the<lb/>  
next. Up and down, up and down the whole time, for so<lb/>  
many, many long years, that grey hairs set in, and old age<lb/>  
was beginning to get close aboard—and I as poor as ever.<lb/>  
It has been rub and go with me ever since; and I have had<lb/>  
as much as I could do to keep the brig in motion, as the<lb/>  
only means that was left to make the two ends meet.”</p>
            <p>“And did not all this make you think of your poor wife<lb/>  
—she whom you had so wronged?”</p>
            <pb n="200"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“I thought of little else, until I heard of her death at<lb/>  
New Or<hi rend="italics">leens</hi>—and then I gave it up as useless. Could I<lb/>  
have fallen in with Molly at any time a'ter the first six<lb/>  
months of my desartion, she and I would have come <lb/>together again, and everything would have been forgotten. I<lb/>  
knowed her very nature, which was all forgiveness to me<lb/>  
at the bottom, though seemingly so spiteful and hard.”</p>
            <p>“Yet you wanted to have this Rose Budd, who is only<lb/>  
too young, and handsome, and good for you.”</p>
            <p>“I was tired of being a widower, Jack; and Rose <hi rend="italics">is  
 </hi>
               <lb/> wonderful pretty. She has money, too, and might make<lb/>  
the evening of my days comfortable. The brig was old,<lb/>  
as you must know, and has long been off of all the <lb/>Insurance Offices' books; and she could n't hold together much<lb/>  
longer. But for this sloop-of-war, I should have put her<lb/>  
off on the Mexicans; and they would have lost her to our<lb/>  
people in a month.”</p>
            <p>“And was it an honest thing to sell an old and worn-out<lb/>  
craft to any one, Stephen Spike?”</p>
            <p>Spike had a conscience that had become hard as iron<lb/>  
by means of trade. He who traffics much, most especially<lb/>  
if his dealings be on so small a scale as to render constant<lb/>  
investigations of the minor qualities of things necessary,<lb/>  
must be a very fortunate man, if he preserve his <lb/>conscience in any better condition. When Jack made this<lb/>  
allusion, therefore, the dying man—for death was much<lb/>  
nearer to Spike that even be supposed, though he no longer<lb/>  
hoped for his own recovery—when Jack made this <lb/>allusion, then, the dying man was a good deal at a loss to <lb/>comprehend it. He saw no particular harm in making the<lb/>  
best bargain he could; nor was it easy for him to <lb/>understand why he might not dispose of anything he possessed<lb/>  
for the highest price that was to be had. Still he answered<lb/>  
in an apologetic sort of way.</p>
            <p>“The brig was old, I acknowledge,” he said, “but she<lb/>  
was strong, and <hi rend="italics">might</hi> have run a long time. I only spoke<lb/>  
of her capture as a thing likely to take place soon, if the<lb/>  
Mexicans got her; so that her qualities were of no great<lb/>  
account, unless it might be her speed—and that you know<lb/>  
was excellent, Jack.”</p>
            <pb n="201"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“And you regret that brig, Stephen Spike, lying as you<lb/>  
do on your death-bed, more than anything else.”</p>
            <p>“Not as much as I do pretty Rose Budd, Jack; Rosy<lb/>  
is so delightful to look at!”</p>
            <p>The muscles of Jack's face twitched a little, and she<lb/>  
looked deeply mortified; for, to own the truth, she hoped<lb/>  
that the conversation had so far turned her delinquent<lb/>  
husband's thoughts to the past, as to have revived in him<lb/>  
some of his former interest in herself. It is true, he still<lb/>  
believed her dead; but this was a circumstance Jack <lb/>overlooked—so hard is it to hear the praises of a rival, and be<lb/>  
just. She felt the necessity of being more explicit, and<lb/>  
determined at once to come to the point.</p>
            <p>“Stephen Spike,” she said, steadily, drawing near to<lb/>  
the bed-side, “you should be told the truth, when you are<lb/>  
heard thus extolling the good looks of Rose Budd, with<lb/>  
less than eight-and-forty hours of life remaining. Mary<lb/>  
Swash did not die, as you have supposed, three years a'ter<lb/>  
you desarted her, but is living at this moment. Had you<lb/>  
read the letter I gave you in the boat, just before you made<lb/>  
me jump into the sea, <hi rend="italics">that</hi> would have told you where she<lb/>  
is to be found.”</p>
            <p>Spike stared at the speaker intently; and when her<lb/>  
cracked voice ceased, his look was that of a man who was<lb/>  
terrified as well as bewildered. This did not arise still from<lb/>  
any gleamings of the real state of the case, but from the<lb/>  
soreness with which his conscience pricked him, when he<lb/>  
heard that his much-wronged wife was alive. He fancied,<lb/>  
with a vivid and rapid glance at the probabilities, all that<lb/>  
a woman abandoned would be likely to endure in the course<lb/>  
of so many long and suffering years.</p>
            <p>“Are you sure of what you say, Jack? You would n't<lb/>  
take advantage of my situation to tell me an untruth?”</p>
            <p>“As certain of it as of my own existence. I have seen<lb/>  
her quite lately—talked with her of <hi rend="italics">you</hi>—in short, she is<lb/>  
now at Key West, knows your state, and has a wife's <lb/>feelin's to come to your bed-side.”</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this, and the many gleamings he had<lb/>  
had of the facts during their late intercourse on board the<lb/>  
brig, Spike did not guess at the truth. He appeared <lb/>astounded, and his terror seemed to increase.</p>
            <pb n="202"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“I have another thing to tell you,” continued Jack,<lb/>  
pausing but a moment to collect her own thoughts. “Jack<lb/>  
Tier—the real Jack Tier—he who sailed with you of old,<lb/>  
and whom you left ashore at the same time you desarted<lb/>  
your wife, <hi rend="italics">did</hi> die of the fever, as you was told, in <lb/>eight-and-forty hours a'ter the brig went to sea.”</p>
            <p>“Then who, in the name of Heaven, are you? How<lb/>  
came you to hail by another's name as well as by another<lb/>  
sex?”</p>
            <p>“What could a woman do, whose husband had desarted<lb/>  
her in a strange land?”</p>
            <p>“That is remarkable! So <hi rend="italics">you</hi>'ve been married? I<lb/>  
should not have thought <hi rend="italics">that</hi> possible; and your husband<lb/>  
desarted you, too. Well, such things <hi rend="italics">do</hi> happen.”</p>
            <p>Jack now felt a severe pang. She could not but see<lb/>  
that her ungainly—we had almost said her unearthly <lb/>appearance—prevented the captain from even yet suspecting<lb/>  
the truth; and the meaning of his language was not easily<lb/>  
to be mistaken. That any one should have married <hi rend="italics">her,  
 </hi>
               <lb/> seemed to her husband as improbable as it was probable he<lb/>  
would run away from her as soon as it was in his power<lb/>  
after the ceremony.</p>
            <p>“Stephen Spike,” resumed Jack, solemnly, “<hi rend="italics">I</hi> am Mary<lb/>  
Swash—<hi rend="italics">I</hi> am your wife!”</p>
            <p>Spike started in his bed; then he buried his face in the<lb/>  
coverlet—and he actually groaned. In bitterness of spirit<lb/>  
the woman turned away and wept. Her feelings had been<lb/>  
blunted by misfortune and the collisions of a selfish world;<lb/>  
but enough of former self remained to make this the <lb/>hardest of all the blows she had ever received. Her husband,<lb/>  
dying as he was, as he must and did know himself to be,<lb/>  
shrunk from one of her appearance, unsexed as she had<lb/>  
become by habits, and changed by years and suffering.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> has again become necessary to advance the time; and<lb/>  
we shall take the occasion thus offered to make a few <lb/>explanations touching certain events which have been passed<lb/>  
over without notice.</p>
            <p>The reason why Captain Mull did not chase the yawl<lb/>  
of the brig in the Poughkeepsie herself, was the necessity<lb/>  
of waiting for his own boats that were endeavouring to <lb/>regain the sloop-of-war. It would not have done to abandon<lb/>  
them, inasmuch as the men were so much exhausted by<lb/>  
the pull to windward, that when they reached the vessel<lb/>  
all were relieved from duty for the rest of the day. As<lb/>  
soon, however, as the other boats were hoisted in, or run<lb/>  
up, the ship filled away, stood out of the passage and ran<lb/>  
down to join the cutter of Wallace, which was <lb/>endeavouring to keep its position, as much as possible, by making<lb/>  
short tacks under close-reefed luggs.</p>
            <p>Spike had been received on board the sloop-of-war, sent<lb/>  
into her sick bay, and put under the care of the surgeon<lb/>  
and his assistants. From the first, these gentlemen <lb/>pronounced the hurt mortal. The wounded man was <lb/>insensible most of the time, until the ship had beat up and gone<lb/>  
into Key West, where he was transferred to the regular<lb/>  
hospital, as has already been mentioned.</p>
            <p>The wreckers went out the moment the news of the<lb/>  
calamity of the Swash reached their ears. Some went in<lb/>  
quest of the doubloons of the schooner, and others to pick<lb/>  
up anything valuable that might be discovered in the <lb/>neighbourhood of the stranded brig. It may be mentioned<lb/>
               <pb n="204"/>  
here, that not much was ever obtained from the brigantine,<lb/>  
with the exception of a few spars, the sails, and a little<lb/>  
rigging; but, in the end, the schooner was raised, by means<lb/>  
of the chain Spike had placed around her, the cabin was<lb/>  
ransacked, and the doubloons were recovered. As there<lb/>  
was no one to claim the money, it was quietly divided<lb/>  
among the conscientious citizens present at its re-visiting<lb/>  
“the glimpses of the moon,” making gold plenty.</p>
            <p>The doubloons in the yawl would have been lost but for<lb/>  
the sagacity of Mulford. He too well knew the character<lb/>  
of Spike to believe he would quit the brig without taking<lb/>  
the doubloons with him. Acquainted with the boat, he<lb/>  
examined the little locker in the stern-sheets, and found<lb/>  
the two bags, one of which was probably the lawful <lb/>property of Captain Spike, while the other, in truth, belonged<lb/>  
to the Mexican government. The last contained the most<lb/>  
gold, but the first amounted to a sum that our young mate<lb/>  
knew to be very considerable. Rose had made him <lb/>acquainted with the sex of Jack Tier since their own <lb/>marriage; and he at once saw that the claims of this uncouth<lb/>  
wife, who was so soon to be a widow, to the gold in <lb/>question, might prove to be as good in law, as they <lb/>unquestionably were in morals. On representing the facts of the case<lb/>  
to Captain Mull and the legal functionaries at Key West,<lb/>  
it was determined to relinquish this money to the heirs of<lb/>  
Spike, as, indeed, they must have done under process, there<lb/>  
being no other claimant. These doubloons, however, did<lb/>  
not amount to the full price of the flour and powder that<lb/>  
composed the cargo of the Swash. The cargo had been<lb/>  
purchased with Mexican funds; and all that Spike or his<lb/>  
heirs could claim, was the high freight for which he had<lb/>  
undertaken the delicate office of transporting those <lb/>forbidden articles, contraband of war, to the Dry Tortugas.</p>
            <p>Mulford by this time was high in the confidence and<lb/>  
esteem of all on board the Poughkeepsie. He had frankly<lb/>  
explained his whole connexion with Spike, not even <lb/>attempting to conceal the reluctance he had felt to betray the brig<lb/>  
after he had fully ascertained the fact of his commander's<lb/>  
treason. The manly gentlemen with whom he was now<lb/>  
brought in contact entered into his feelings, and admitted<lb/>  
that it was an office no one could desire, to turn against<lb/>
               <pb n="205"/>
               <milestone unit="collation"/>  
the craft in which he sailed. It is true, they could not<lb/>  
and would not be traitors, but Mulford had stopped far<lb/>  
short of this; and the distinction between such a character<lb/>  
and that of an informer was wide enough to satisfy all their<lb/>  
scruples.</p>
            <p>Then Rose had the greatest success with the gentlemen<lb/>  
of the Poughkeepsie. Her youth, beauty, and modesty,<lb/>  
told largely in her favour; and the simple, womanly <lb/>affection she unconsciously betrayed in behalf of Harry, touched<lb/>  
the heart of every observer. When the intelligence of<lb/>  
her aunt's fate reached her, the sorrow she manifested was<lb/>  
so profound and natural, that every one sympathized with<lb/>  
her grief. Nor would she be satisfied unless Mulford<lb/>  
would consent to go in search of the bodies. The latter<lb/>  
knew the hopelessness of such an excursion, but he could<lb/>  
not refuse to comply. He was absent on that melancholy<lb/>  
duty, therefore, at the moment of the scene related in our<lb/>  
last chapter, and did not return until after that which we<lb/>  
are now about to lay before the reader. Mrs. Budd, Biddy,<lb/>  
and all of those who perished after the yawl got clear of<lb/>  
the reef, were drowned in deep water, and no more was<lb/>  
ever seen of any of them; or, if wreckers did pass them,<lb/>  
they did not stop to bury the dead. It was different, <lb/>however, with those, who were first sacrificed to Spike's <lb/>selfishness. They were drowned on the reef, and Harry did<lb/>  
actually recover the bodies of the Señor Montefalderon,<lb/>  
and of Josh, the steward. They had washed upon a rock<lb/>  
that is bare at low water. He took them both to the Dry<lb/>  
Tortugas, and had them interred along with the other dead<lb/>  
at that place. Don Juan was placed side by side with his<lb/>  
unfortunate countryman, the master of his equally <lb/>unfortunate schooner.</p>
            <p>While Harry was absent and thus employed, Rose wept<lb/>  
much and prayed more. She would have felt herself<lb/>  
almost alone in the world, but for the youth to whom she<lb/>  
had so recently, less than a week before, plighted her faith<lb/>  
in wedlock. That new tie, it is true, was of sufficient <lb/>importance to counteract many of the ordinary feelings of<lb/>  
her situation; and she now turned to it as the one which<lb/>  
absorbed most of the future duties of her life. Still she<lb/>  
missed the kindness, the solicitude, even the weaknesses<lb/>
               <pb n="206"/>  
of her aunt; and the terrible manner in which Mrs. Budd<lb/>  
had perished, made her shudder with horror whenever she<lb/>  
thought of it. Poor Biddy, too, came in for her share of<lb/>  
the regrets. This faithful creature, who had been in the<lb/>  
relict's service ever since Rose's infancy, had become <lb/>endeared to her, in spite of her uncouth manners and <lb/>confused ideas, by the warmth of her heart, and the singular<lb/>  
truth of her feelings. Biddy, of all her family, had come<lb/>  
to America, leaving behind her not only brothers and <lb/>sisters, but parents living. Each year did she remit to the<lb/>  
last a moiety of her earnings, and many a half-dollar that<lb/>  
had come from Rose's pretty little hand, had been <lb/>converted into gold, and forwarded on the same pious errand<lb/>  
to the green island of her nativity. Ireland, unhappy<lb/>  
country! at this moment what are not the dire necessities<lb/>  
of thy poor! Here, from the midst of abundance, in a<lb/>  
land that God has blessed in its productions far beyond the<lb/>  
limits of human wants, a land in which famine was never<lb/>  
known, do we at this moment hear thy groans, and listen<lb/>  
to tales of suffering that to us seem almost incredible. In<lb/>  
the midst of these chilling narratives, our eyes fall on an<lb/>  
appeal to the English nation, that appears in what it is the<lb/>  
fashion of some to term the first journal of Europe (!) in<lb/>  
behalf of thy suffering people. A worthy appeal to the<lb/>  
charity of England seldom fails; but it seems to us that<lb/>  
one sentiment of this might have been altered, if not spared.<lb/>  
The English are asked to be “<hi rend="italics">forgetful</hi> of the past,” and<lb/>  
to come forward to the relief of their suffering <lb/>fellow-subjects. We should have written “<hi rend="italics">mindful</hi> of the past,” in<lb/>  
its stead. We say this in charity, as well as in truth. We<lb/>  
come of English blood, and if we claim to share in all the<lb/>  
ancient renown of that warlike and enlightened people, we<lb/>  
are equally bound to share in the reproaches that original<lb/>  
misgovernment has inflicted on thee. In this latter sense,<lb/>  
then, thou hast a right to our sympathies, and they are not<lb/>  
withheld.</p>
            <p>As has been already said, we now advance the time<lb/>  
eight-and-forty hours, and again transfer the scene to that<lb/>  
room in the hospital which was occupied by Spike. The<lb/>  
approaches of death, during the interval just named, had<lb/>  
been slow but certain. The surgeons had announced that<lb/>
               <pb n="207"/>  
the wounded man could not possibly survive the coming<lb/>  
night; and he himself had been made sensible that his end<lb/>  
was near. It is scarcely necessary to add that Stephen<lb/>  
Spike, conscious of his vigour and strength, in command<lb/>  
of his brig, and bent on the pursuits of worldly gains, or<lb/>  
of personal gratification, was a very different person from<lb/>  
him who now lay stretched on his pallet in the hospital of<lb/>  
Key West, a dying man. By the side of his bed still sat<lb/>  
his strange nurse, less peculiar in appearance, however,<lb/>  
than when last seen by the reader.</p>
            <p>Rose Budd had been ministering to the ungainly <lb/>externals of Jack Tier. She now wore a cap, thus concealing<lb/>  
the short, grey bristles of hair, and lending to her <lb/>countenance a little of that softness which is a requisite of<lb/>  
female character. Some attention had also been paid to<lb/>  
the rest of her attire; and Jack was, altogether, less <lb/>repulsive in her exterior than when, unaided, she had<lb/>  
attempted to resume the proper garb of her sex. Use and<lb/>  
association, too, had contributed a little to revive her<lb/>  
woman's nature, if we may so express it, and she had begun,<lb/>  
in particular, to feel the sort of interest in her patient which<lb/>  
we all come in time to entertain toward any object of our<lb/>  
especial care. We do not mean that Jack had absolutely<lb/>  
ever ceased to love her husband; strange as it may seem,<lb/>  
such had not literally been the case; on the contrary, her<lb/>  
interest in him and in his welfare had never ceased, even<lb/>  
while she saw his vices and detested his crimes; but all<lb/>  
we wish to say here is, that she was getting, in addition to<lb/>  
the long-enduring feelings of a wife, some of the interest<lb/>  
of a nurse.</p>
            <p>During the whole time which had elapsed between<lb/>  
Jack's revealing her true character, and the moment of<lb/>  
which we are now writing, Spike had not once spoken to<lb/>  
his wife. Often had she caught his eyes intently riveted<lb/>  
on her, when he would turn them away, as she feared, in<lb/>  
distaste; and once or twice he groaned deeply, more like a<lb/>  
man who suffered mental than bodily pain. Still the patient<lb/>  
did not speak once in all the time mentioned. We should<lb/>  
be representing poor Jack as possessing more philosophy,<lb/>  
or less feeling, than the truth would warrant, were we to<lb/>  
say that she was not hurt at this conduct in her husband.<lb/>
               <pb n="208"/>  
On the contrary, she felt it deeply; and more than once it<lb/>  
had so far subdued her pride, as to cause her bitterly to<lb/>  
weep. This shedding of tears, however, was of service to<lb/>  
Jack in one sense, for it had the effect of renewing old<lb/>  
impressions, and in a certain way, of reviving the nature<lb/>  
of her sex within her—a nature which had been sadly<lb/>  
weakened by her past life.</p>
            <p>But the hour had at length come when this long and<lb/>  
painful silence was to be broken. Jack and Rose were<lb/>  
alone with the patient, when the last again spoke to his<lb/>  
wife.</p>
            <p>“Molly—poor Molly!” said the dying man, his voice<lb/>  
continuing full and deep to the last, “what a sad time you<lb/>  
must have had of it after I did you that wrong!”</p>
            <p>“It is hard upon a woman, Stephen, to turn her out,<lb/>  
helpless, on a cold and selfish world,” answered Jack, <lb/>simply, much too honest to affect a reserve she did not feel.</p>
            <p>“It was hard, indeed; may God forgive me for it, as I<lb/>  
hope ye do, Molly.”</p>
            <p>No answer was made to this appeal; and the invalid<lb/>  
looked anxiously at his wife. The last sat at her work,<lb/>  
which had now got to be less awkward to her, with her eyes<lb/>  
bent on her needle,—her countenance rigid, and, so far<lb/>  
as the eye could discern, her feelings unmoved.</p>
            <p>“Your husband speaks to you, Jack Tier,” said Rose,<lb/>  
pointedly.</p>
            <p>“May <hi rend="italics">yours</hi> never have occasion to speak to you, Rose<lb/>  
Budd, in the same way,” was the solemn answer. “I do<lb/>  
not flatter myself that I ever was as comely as you, or that<lb/>  
yonder poor dying wretch was a Harry Mulford in his<lb/>  
youth; but we were young and happy, and respected once,<lb/>  
and loved each other, yet you see what it's all come to!”</p>
            <p>Rose was silenced, though she had too much tenderness<lb/>  
in behalf of her own youthful and manly bridegroom to<lb/>  
dread a fate similar to that which had overtaken poor Jack.<lb/>  
Spike now seemed disposed to say something, and she went<lb/>  
to the side of his bed, followed by her companion, who<lb/>  
kept a little in the back-ground, as if unwilling to let the<lb/>  
emotion she really felt be seen, and, perhaps, conscious that<lb/>  
her ungainly appearance did not aid her in recovering the<lb/>  
lost affections of her husband.</p>
            <pb n="209"/>
            <p/>
            <milestone unit="collation"/>
            <p>“I have been a very wicked man, I fear,” said Spike,<lb/>  
earnestly.</p>
            <p>“There are none without sin,” answered Rose. “Place<lb/>  
your reliance on the mediation of the Son of God, and sins<lb/>  
even far deeper than yours may be pardoned.”</p>
            <p>The captain stared at the beautiful speaker, but <lb/>self-indulgence, the incessant pursuit of worldly and selfish<lb/>  
objects for forty years, and the habits of a life into which<lb/>  
the thought of God and the dread hereafter never entered,<lb/>  
had encased his spiritual being in a sort of brazen armour,<lb/>  
through which no ordinary blow of conscience could <lb/>penetrate. Still he had fearful glimpses of recent events, and<lb/>  
his soul, hanging as it was over the abyss of eternity, was<lb/>  
troubled.</p>
            <p>“What has become of your aunt?” half whispered Spike<lb/>  
—“my old captain's widow. She ought to be here; and<lb/>  
Don Wan Montezuma—where is he?”</p>
            <p>Rose turned aside to conceal her tears—but no one <lb/>answered the questions of the dying man. Then a gleaming<lb/>  
of childhood shot into the recollection of Spike, and,<lb/>  
clasping his hands, he tried to pray. But, like others who<lb/>  
have lived without any communication with their Creator<lb/>  
through long lives of apathy to his existence and laws,<lb/>  
thinking only of the present time, and daily, hourly <lb/>sacrificing principles and duty to the narrow interests of the<lb/>  
moment, he now found how hard it is to renew <lb/>communications with a being who has been so long neglected. The<lb/>  
fault lay in himself, however, for a gracious ear was open,<lb/>  
even over the death-bed of Stephen Spike, could that rude<lb/>  
spirit only bring itself to ask for mercy in earnestness and<lb/>  
truth. As his companions saw his struggles, they left him<lb/>  
for a few minutes to his own thoughts.</p>
            <p>“Molly,” Spike at length uttered, in a faint tone, the<lb/>  
voice of one conscious of being very near his end, “I hope<lb/>  
you will forgive me, Molly. I know you must have a hard,<lb/>  
hard time of it.”</p>
            <p>“It is hard for a woman to unsex herself, Stephen; to<lb/>  
throw off her very natur', as it might be, and to turn man.”</p>
            <p>“It has changed you sadly—even your speech is altered.<lb/>  
Once your voice was soft and womanish—more like that<lb/>  
of Rose Budd's than it is now.”</p>
            <pb n="210"/>
            <p/>
            <p>“I speak as them speak among whom I've been forced<lb/>  
to live. The forecastle and steward's pantry, Stephen<lb/>  
Spike, are poor schools to send women to l'arn language<lb/>  
in.”</p>
            <p>“Try and forget it all, poor Molly! Say to me, so that<lb/>  
I can hear you, ‘I forget and forgive, Stephen.’ I am<lb/>  
afraid God will not pardon my sins, which begin to seem<lb/>  
dreadful to me, if my own wife refuse to forget and forgive,<lb/>  
on my dying bed.”</p>
            <p>Jack was much mollified by this appeal. Her interest<lb/>  
in her offending husband had never been entirely <lb/>extinguished. She had remembered him, and often with woman's<lb/>  
kindness, in all her wanderings and sufferings, as the <lb/>preceding parts of our narrative must show; and though <lb/>resentment had been mingled with the grief and mortification<lb/>  
she felt at finding how much he still submitted to Rose's<lb/>  
superior charms, in a breast as really generous and humane<lb/>  
as that of Jack Tier's, such a feeling was not likely to <lb/>endure in the midst of a scene like that she was now called<lb/>  
to witness. The muscles of her countenance twitched,<lb/>  
the hard-looking, tanned face began to lose its sternness,<lb/>  
and every way she appeared like one profoundly disturbed.</p>
            <p>“Turn to Him whose goodness and marcy may sarve<lb/>  
you, Stephen,” she said, in a milder and more feminine<lb/>  
tone than she had used now for years, making her more<lb/>  
like herself than either her husband or Rose had seen her<lb/>  
since the commencement of the late voyage; “my sayin'<lb/>  
that I forget and forgive cannot help a man on his <lb/>deathbed.”</p>
            <p>“It will settle my mind, Molly, and leave me freer to<lb/>  
turn my thoughts to God.”</p>
            <p>Jack was much affected, more by the countenance and<lb/>  
manner of the sufferer, perhaps, than by his words. She<lb/>  
drew nearer to the side of her husband's pallet, knelt, took<lb/>  
his hands, and said solemnly,</p>
            <p>“Stephen Spike, from the bottom of my heart, I <hi rend="italics">do</hi>
               <lb/>forgive you; and I shall pray to God that he will pardon your<lb/>  
sins as freely and more marcifully than I now pardon all,<lb/>  
and try to forget all that you have done to me.”</p>
            <p>Spike clasped his hands, and again he tried to pray; but<lb/>  
the habits of a whole life are not to be thrown off at will;<lb/>
               <pb n="211"/>  
and he who endeavours to regain, in his extremity, the<lb/>  
moments that have been lost, will find, in bitter reality,<lb/>  
that he has been heaping mountains on his own soul, by<lb/>  
the mere practice of sin, which were never laid there by<lb/>  
the original fall of his race. Jack, however, had <lb/>disburthened her spirit of a load that had long oppressed it, and,<lb/>  
burying her face in the rug, she wept.</p>
            <p>“I wish, Molly,” said the dying man, several minutes<lb/>  
later, “I wish I had never seen the brig. Until I got that<lb/>  
craft, no thought of wronging human being ever crossed<lb/>  
my mind.”</p>
            <p>“It was the Father of Lies that tempts all to do evil,<lb/>  
Stephen, and not the brig which caused the sins.”</p>
            <p>“I wish I could live a year longer—<hi rend="italics">only</hi> one year; that<lb/>  
is not much to ask for a man who is not yet sixty.”</p>
            <p>“It is hopeless, poor Stephen. The surgeons say you<lb/>  
cannot live one day.”</p>
            <p>Spike groaned—for the past, blended fearfully with the<lb/>  
future, gleamed on his conscience with a brightness that<lb/>  
appalled him. And what is that future, which is to make<lb/>  
us happy or miserable through an endless vista of time?<lb/>  
Is it not composed of an existence, in which conscience,<lb/>  
released from the delusions and weaknesses of the body,<lb/>  
sees all in its true colours, appreciates all, and punishes<lb/>  
all? Such an existence would make every man the keeper<lb/>  
of the record of his own transgressions, even to the most<lb/>  
minute exactness. It would of itself mete out perfect <lb/>justice, since the sin would be seen amid its accompanying<lb/>  
facts, every aggravating or extenuating circumstance.<lb/>  
Each man would be strictly punished according to his<lb/>  
talents. As no one is without sin, it makes the necessity<lb/>  
of an atonement indispensable, and, in its most rigid <lb/>interpretation, it exhibits the truth of the scheme of salvation<lb/>  
in the clearest colours. The soul, or conscience, that can<lb/>  
admit the necessary degree of faith in that atonement, and<lb/>  
in admitting, <hi rend="italics">feels</hi> its efficacy, throws the burthen of its<lb/>  
own transgressions away, and remains for ever in the<lb/>  
condition of its original existence, pure, and consequently<lb/>  
happy.</p>
            <p>We do not presume to lay down a creed on this mighty<lb/>  
and mysterious matter, in which all have so deep an <lb/>
               <pb n="212"/>interest, and concerning which so very small a portion of the<lb/>  
human race think much, or think with any clearness when<lb/>  
it does become the subject of their passing thoughts at all<lb/>  
We too well know our own ignorance to venture on <lb/>dogmas which it has probably been intended that the mind of<lb/>  
man should not yet grapple with and comprehend. To<lb/>  
return to our subject.</p>
            <p>Stephen Spike was now made to feel the incubus-load,<lb/>  
which perseverance in sin heaps on the breast of the <lb/>reckless offender. What was the most grievous of all, his<lb/>  
power to shake off this dead weight was diminished in<lb/>  
precisely the same proportion as the burthen was increased,<lb/>  
the moral force of every man lessening in a very just ratio<lb/>  
to the magnitude of his delinquencies. Bitterly did this<lb/>  
deep offender struggle with his conscience, and little did<lb/>  
his half-unsexed wife know how to console or aid him.<lb/>  
Jack had been superficially instructed in the dogmas of<lb/>  
her faith, in childhood and youth, as most persons are <lb/>instructed in what are termed Christian communities—had<lb/>  
been made to learn the Catechism, the Lord's Prayer, and<lb/>  
the Creed—and had been left to set up for herself on this<lb/>  
small capital, in the great concern of human existence, on<lb/>  
her marriage and entrance on the active business of life.<lb/>  
When the manner in which she had passed the last twenty<lb/>  
years is remembered, no one can be surprised to learn that<lb/>  
Jack was of little assistance to her husband in his <lb/>extremity. Rose made an effort to administer hope and <lb/>consolation, but the terrible nature of the struggle she <lb/>witnessed, induced her to send for the chaplain of the <lb/>Poughkeepsie. This divine prayed with the dying man; but<lb/>  
even he, in the last moments of the sufferer, was little<lb/>  
more than a passive but shocked witness of remorse, <lb/>suspended over the abyss of eternity in hopeless dread. We<lb/>  
shall not enter into the details of the revolting scene, but<lb/>  
simply add that curses, blasphemy, tremulous cries for<lb/>  
mercy, agonized entreaties to be advised, and sullen <lb/>defiance, were all strangely and fearfully blended. In the<lb/>  
midst of one of these revolting paroxysms, Spike breathed<lb/>  
his last. A few hours later, his body was interred in the<lb/>  
sands of the shore. It may be well to say in this place,<lb/>  
that the hurricane of 1846, which is known to have <lb/>
               <pb n="213"/>occurred only a few months later, swept off the frail <lb/>covering, and that the body was washed away to leave its bones<lb/>  
among the wrecks and relics of the Florida Reef.</p>
            <p>Mulford did not return from his fruitless expedition<lb/>  
in quest of the remains of Mrs. Budd, until after the death<lb/>  
and interment of Spike. As nothing remained to be done<lb/>  
at Key West, he and Rose accompanied by Jack Tier,<lb/>  
took passage for Charleston in the first convenient vessel<lb/>  
that offered. Two days before they sailed, the <lb/>Poughkeepsie went out to cruise in the Gulf, agreeably to her<lb/>  
general orders. The evening previously Captain Mull,<lb/>  
Wallace, and the chaplain, passed with the bridegroom<lb/>  
and bride, when the matter of the doubloons found in the<lb/>  
boat was discussed. It was agreed that Jack Tier should<lb/>  
have them; and into her hands the bag was now placed.<lb/>  
On this occasion, to oblige the officers, Jack went into a<lb/>  
narrative of all she had seen and suffered, from the<lb/>  
moment when abandoned by her late husband down to<lb/>  
that when she found him again. It was a strange account,<lb/>  
and one filled with surprising adventures. In most of the<lb/>  
vessels in which she had served, Jack had acted in the<lb/>  
steward's department, though she had frequently done duty<lb/>  
as a fore-mast hand. In strength and skill she admitted<lb/>  
that she had often failed; but in courage, never. Having<lb/>  
been given reason to think her husband was reduced to<lb/>  
serving in a vessel of war, she had shipped on board a<lb/>  
frigate bound to the Mediterranean, and had actually made<lb/>  
a whole cruise as a ward-room boy on that station. While<lb/>  
thus employed, she had met with two of the gentlemen<lb/>  
present; Captain Mull and Mr. Wallace. The former was<lb/>  
then first-lieutenant of the frigate, and the latter a <lb/>passed-midshipman; and in these capacities both had been well<lb/>  
known to her. As the name she then bore was the same<lb/>  
as that under which she now “hailed,” these officers were<lb/>  
soon made to recollect her, though Jack was no longer the<lb/>  
light, trim-built lad he had then appeared to be. Neither<lb/>  
of the gentlemen named had made the whole cruise in the<lb/>  
ship, but each had been promoted and transferred to <lb/>another craft, after being Jack's shipmate rather more than a<lb/>  
year. This information greatly facilitated the affair of the<lb/>  
doubloons.</p>
            <pb n="214"/>
            <p/>
            <p>From Charleston the travellers came north by rail-road.<lb/>  
Harry made several stops by the way, in order to divert<lb/>  
the thoughts of his beautiful young bride from dwelling<lb/>  
too much on the fate of her aunt. He knew that home<lb/>  
would revive all these recollections painfully, and wished<lb/>  
to put off the hour of their return, until time had a little<lb/>  
weakened Rose's regrets. For this reason, he passed a<lb/>  
whole week in Washington, though it was a season of the<lb/>  
year that the place is not in much request. Still, <lb/>Washington is scarce a town, at any season. It is much the<lb/>  
fashion to deride the American capital, and to treat it as a<lb/>  
place of very humble performance with very sounding<lb/>  
pretensions. Certainly, Washington has very few of the<lb/>  
peculiarities of a great European capital, but few as these<lb/>  
are, they are more than belong to any other place in this<lb/>  
country. We now allude to the <hi rend="italics">distinctive</hi> characteristics<lb/>  
of a capital, and not to a mere concentration of houses<lb/>  
and shops within a given space. In this last respect,<lb/>  
Washington is much behind fifty other American towns,<lb/>  
even while it is the only place in the whole republic which<lb/>  
possesses specimens of architecture, on a scale <lb/>approaching that of the higher classes of the edifices of the old<lb/>  
world. It is totally deficient in churches, and theatres,<lb/>  
and markets; or those it does possess are, in an <lb/>architectural sense, not at all above the level of village or <lb/>country-town pretensions, but one or two of its national edifices<lb/>  
do approach the magnificence and grandeur of the old<lb/>  
world. The new Treasury Buildings are unquestionably,<lb/>  
on the score of size, embellishments and finish, <hi rend="italics">the</hi>
               <lb/>American edifice that comes nearest to first class architecture<lb/>  
on the other side of the Atlantic. The Capitol comes<lb/>  
next, though it can scarce be ranked, relatively, as high.<lb/>  
As for the White House, it is every way sufficient for its<lb/>  
purposes and the institutions; and now that its grounds are<lb/>  
finished, and the shrubbery and trees begin to tell, one<lb/>  
sees about it something that is not unworthy of its high<lb/>  
uses and origin. Those grounds, which so long lay a <lb/>reproach to the national taste and liberality, are now fast<lb/>  
becoming beautiful, are already exceedingly pretty, and<lb/>  
give to a structure that is destined to become historical,<lb/>  
having already associated with it the names of Jefferson,<lb/>
               <pb n="215"/>  
Madison, Jackson, and Quincy Adams, together with the<lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">ci polloi</hi> of the later Presidents, an <hi rend="italics">entourage</hi> that is <lb/>suitable to its past recollections and its present purposes.<lb/>  
They are not quite on a level with the parks of London,<lb/>  
it is true; or even with the Tuileries, or Luxembourg, or<lb/>  
the Boboli, or the Villa Reale, or fifty more grounds and<lb/>  
gardens, of a similar nature, that might be mentioned;<lb/>  
but, seen in the spring and early summer, they adorn the<lb/>  
building they surround, and lend to the whole <lb/>neighbourhood a character of high civilization, that no other place<lb/>  
in America can show, in precisely the same form, or to the<lb/>  
same extent.</p>
            <p>This much have we said on the subject of the White<lb/>  
House and its precincts, because we took occasion, in a<lb/>  
former work, to berate the narrow-minded parsimony<lb/>  
which left the grounds of the White House in a condition<lb/>  
that was discreditable to the republic. How far our <lb/>philippic may have hastened the improvements which have<lb/>  
been made, is more than we shall pretend to say; but<lb/>  
having made the former strictures, we are happy to have an<lb/>  
occasion to say (though nearly twenty years have <lb/>intervened between the expressions of the two opinions) that<lb/>  
they are no longer merited.</p>
            <p>And here we will add another word, and that on a <lb/>subject that is not sufficiently pressed on the attention of a<lb/>  
people, who, by position, are unavoidably provincial. We<lb/>  
invite those whose gorges rise at any stricture on anything<lb/>  
American, and who fancy it is enough to belong to the<lb/>  
great republic to be great in itself, to place themselves in<lb/>  
front of the State Department, as it now stands, and to<lb/>  
examine its dimensions, material and form with critical<lb/>  
eyes, then to look along the adjacent Treasury Buildings,<lb/>  
to fancy them completed, by a junction with new edifices<lb/>  
of a similar construction to contain the department of<lb/>  
state; next to fancy similar works completed for the two<lb/>  
opposite departments; after which, to compare the past<lb/>  
and present with the future as thus finished, and <lb/>remember how recent has been the partial improvement which<lb/>  
even now exists. If this examination and comparison do<lb/>  
not show, directly to the sense of sight, how much there<lb/>  
was and is to criticise, as put in contrast with other <lb/>
               <pb n="216"/>countries, we shall give up the individuals in question, as too<lb/>  
deeply dyed in the provincial wool ever to be whitened.<lb/>  
The present Trinity church, New York, certainly not more<lb/>  
than a third class European church, if as much, compared<lb/>  
with its village-like predecessor, may supply a practical<lb/>  
homily of the same degree of usefulness. There may be<lb/>  
those among us, however, who fancy it patriotism to <lb/>maintain that the old Treasury Buildings were quite equal<lb/>  
to the new, and of these intense Americans we cry their<lb/>  
mercy!</p>
            <p>Rose felt keenly on reaching her late aunt's very neat<lb/>  
dwelling in Fourteenth Street, New York. But the manly<lb/>  
tenderness of Mulford was a great support to her, and a<lb/>  
little time brought her to think of that weak-minded, but<lb/>  
well-meaning and affectionate relative, with gentle regret,<lb/>  
rather than with grief. Among the connexions of her<lb/>  
young husband, she found several females of a class in life<lb/>  
certainly equal to her own, and somewhat superior to the<lb/>  
latter in education and habits. As for Harry, he very<lb/>  
gladly passed the season with his beautiful bride, though a<lb/>  
fine ship was laid down for him, by means of Rose's <lb/>fortune, now much increased by her aunt's death, and he was<lb/>  
absent in Europe when his son was born; an event that<lb/>  
occurred only two months since.</p>
            <p>The Swash, and the shipment of gunpowder, were<lb/>  
thought of no more in the good town of Manhattan. This<lb/>  
great emporium—we beg pardon, this great <hi rend="italics">commercial  
 </hi>
               <lb/> emporium—has a trick of forgetting, condensing all <lb/>interests into those of the present moment. It is much <lb/>addicted to believing that which never had an existence, and<lb/>  
of overlooking that which is occurring directly <hi rend="italics">under its<lb/>  
nose</hi>. So marked is this tendency to forgetfulness, we<lb/>  
should not be surprised to hear some of the Manhattanese<lb/>  
pretend that our legend is nothing but a fiction, and deny<lb/>  
the existence of the Molly, Captain Spike, and even of<lb/>  
Biddy Noon. But we know them too well to mind what<lb/>  
they say, and shall go on and finish our narrative in our<lb/>  
own way, just as if there were no such raven-throated <lb/>commentators at all.</p>
            <p>Jack Tier, still known by that name, lives in the family<lb/>  
of Captain Mulford. She is fast losing the tan on her face<lb/>
               <pb n="217"/>  
and hands, and every day is improving in appearance. She<lb/>  
now habitually wears her proper attire, and is dropping<lb/>  
gradually into the feelings and habits of her sex. She<lb/>  
never can become what she once was, any more than the<lb/>  
blackamoor can become white, or the leopard change his<lb/>  
spots; but she is no longer revolting. She has left off<lb/>  
chewing and smoking, having found a refuge in snuff.<lb/>  
Her hair is permitted to grow, and is already turned up<lb/>  
with a comb, though constantly concealed beneath a cap.<lb/>  
The heart of Jack, alone, seems unaltered. The strange,<lb/>  
tiger-like affection that she bore for Spike, during twenty<lb/>  
years of abandonment, has disappeared in regrets for his<lb/>  
end. It is succeeded by a most sincere attachment for<lb/>  
Rose, in which the little boy, since his appearance on the<lb/>  
scene, is becoming a large participator. This child Jack<lb/>  
is beginning to love intensely; and the doubloons, well <lb/>invested, placing her above the feeling of dependence, she is<lb/>  
likely to end her life, once so errant and disturbed, in <lb/>tranquillity and a home-like happiness.</p>
