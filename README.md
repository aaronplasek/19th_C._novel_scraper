*TEI/XML Epigraph Scraper*
================
This script pulls XML-tagged content from all the XML files in a directory. This script was written and tested on Macbook Pro and an iMac (both using OS 10.9) using python 2.7.6. It will also work in Linux/Unix. You will need to install Beautiful Soup.

*Instructions*
=============
(1) Install Beautiful Soup. http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

(2) The script should be placed in the same directory as all the files to be scraping.

(3) The current "working directory" of your terminal needs to be the same directory in which you are running your script!
